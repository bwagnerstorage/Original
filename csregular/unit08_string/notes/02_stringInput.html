  <h1>String Input</h1>
  <p>The Scanner class provides two methods for reading strings from the keyboard.</p>
  <h1>next Method</h1>
  <p>The first method we will look at is the <strong>next</strong> method. The next method reads a series of 
     characters until it encounters a delimeter.
	 A delimeter is a special character that separates one piece of data from another. 
	 It is usually a white space character such as a space, tab, or end-of-line character.
	 Once a delimeter has been reach the <strong>next</strong> method combines all of the input characters together into a single string.
	 Look at the following example:</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); <div id="csComment"><pre>// instantiate Scanner object</pre></div>
String str1 = "";
String str2 = "";

System.out.print("Enter two words --> ");
str1 = keyboard.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>next</pre></div>();           <div id="csComment"><pre>// read until white space encountered</pre></div>
str2 = keyboard.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>next</pre></div>();           <div id="csComment"><pre>// read until white space encountered</pre></div>

System.out.println(str1);
System.out.println(str2);</pre>
   </div>
 <p>Below is a sample run of the code above. The words "dog" and "cat" were input from the keyboard. There
    is a space between the two strings and an end-of-line marker after "cat".</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
Enter two words --> dog cat
dog
cat</pre>
 </div>
<p>The string "dog" is read by the first next method and stored in the String variable str1.
   The string "cat" is read by the second next method and stored in the String variable str2.</p>
<h1>nextLine Method</h1>
<p>The second method used to read strings from the keyboard is the <strong>nextLine</strong> method. 
   The nextLine method reads a series of characters from the keyboard until it encounters an
   end-of-line character then converts the characters to a string.</p>
 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);   <div id="csComment"><pre>// instantiate Scanner object</pre></div>
String str;

System.out.print("Enter a sentence --> ");
str = keyboard.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>nextLine</pre></div>();      <div id="csComment"><pre>// reads until end-of-line marker encountered</pre></div>

System.out.println();
System.out.println(str);</pre>
 </div>
 <p>Below is a sample run for the code above. The phrase "Give me liberty or give me death!" was
    entered from the keyboard.</p>
	 <div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
Enter a sentence --> Give me liberty or give me death!

Give me liberty or give me death!</pre>
 </div>
 <p>The string "Give me liberty or give me death!" is read by the nextLine method and stored in the
    String variable str.</p>
  <div id="csNote"><strong>Programming Note:  </strong> I use the nextLine method almost exclusively. It can
  be used to read both strings with or without spaces.</div>
<h1>Removing the End of Line Marker (EOLN)</h1>
<p>When users of a program are typing from the keyboard they press the Enter key to signify the end
   of data entry. The Scanner methods nextInt, nextDouble, and next will read the data from the
   keyboard but they do not remove the end of line marker (EOLN) left when the Enter key was pressed
   after entering the value or values. Look at the following illustration:</p>
 <p>Suppose a person is prompted to type an integer value from the keyboard and they type the number
    57 and press the Enter key. The 57 and an EOLN marker are then placed in a temporary memory
    location called the input stream buffer. The EOLN is denoted below by the symbol [EOLN].</p>
  <div id="csOutput">
  <pre>
Enter an integer --> 57</pre>
  </div>
  <p>The Input Stream buffer would contain the following characters</p>
  <div style="background-color:#BFDFFF; width:350px; font-size:1.3em; margin:0; padding: 5px">
57[EOLN]
  </div>
  <p>Assume that the code segment below prompted the user to enter the value from the keyboard.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter an integer --> ");
int n = keyboard.nextInt();</pre>
 </div>
 <p>The <strong>nextInt</strong> method will remove the value 57 from the Input Stream buffer and store the value in
    the variable n, but it will not read the EOLN marker. The EOLN marker is left on the Input
    Stream buffer.</p>
<div style="background-color:#BFDFFF; width:350px; font-size:1.3em; margin:0; padding: 5px">
[EOLN]
  </div>
  <p>This scenario can cause a problem in your programs when you follow a <strong>nextInt</strong>, <strong>nextDouble</strong>, or <strong>next</strong> method by a <strong>nextLine</strong> method. 
    Let's look at an example.</p>
 <p>Suppose that a person was prompted to type a person's age followed by their name.</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
  <pre>
Enter your age --> 16
Enter your name --> John</pre>
  </div>
 <p>Here is the code segment used to read the keyboard input.</p>
 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter your age -->");
int age = keyboard.nextInt();                 <div id="csComment"><pre>// nextInt</pre></div>
 
System.out.print("Enter your name -->");
String name = keyboard.nextLine();            <div id="csComment"><pre>// followed by nextLine</pre></div>

System.out.println("Age = " + age);
System.out.println("Name = " + name);</pre>
 </div>
 <p>A sample run of the program would actually produce the following output</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
 <pre>
Enter your age -->16
Enter your name -->Age = 16
Name =</pre>
 </div>
 <p>As you can see the program does not produce the desired result. The program does not allow
    the user to enter a name because the nextLine method read the EOLN marker left by the
	nextInt method. This caused the nextLine method to terminate early; not allowing the user
	to enter a name.</p>
  <h3>How to Fix Problem</h3>
  <p>To fix this problem we are going to use what is referred to as a <strong>dummy read</strong>.
     Look at the modified version of the code from above.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter your age -->");
int age = keyboard.nextInt(); 

<div id="csHighlight"><pre>keyboard.nextLine(); </pre></div>   <div id="csComment"><pre>// dummy read</pre></div>

System.out.print("Enter your name -->");
String name = keyboard.nextLine();</pre>
 </div>
 <p>A nextLine statement is inserted into the code between the nextInt statement and the
    nextLine statement. This line of code will remove the EOLN marker left by the nextInt so
	that the second nextLine statement will be able to read the name entered by the
	user.</p>
 <p>The nextLine method of the dummy read is not included in an assignment statement. Since the
    rogue EOLN marker does not serve a purpose there is no need to assign it to a variable.</p>
  <div id="csNote">A <strong>dummy read</strong> is a nextLine statement inserted into code that removes
    an EOLN marker left by the methods next, nextInt, and nextDouble.</div>
