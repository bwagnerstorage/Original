<li><p>Complete the <strong>two nested for loops</strong> and <strong>if statements</strong> so that the program
    displays the song like the sample run below.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the second for loop so that the phrase "a partridge in a pear tree" is

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following code has been added to the inner for loop to cause the output to pause between verses. You have to press the

<p>Notice in the sample output that after the first verse an "and" is used in front of the
   line "a partridge in a pear tree". Your program should do the same. </p>
