<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Write a program that asks the user to enter the size of a triangle to print out,
     then print the triangle by printing a series of lines consisting of asterisks. 
	 The first line will have one asterick, the next two, and so on, with each line 
	 having one more asterisk than the previous line, up to the number entered by the
	 user. On the next line print one less asterisk and continue by decreasing the 
	 number of asterisks by 1 for each successive line until only one asterisk is printed. </p>
   <p>You will need to use <strong>nested for loops</strong> in your implementation. The outside loop
      controls the number of lines to print, and the inside loop controls the number
	  of asterisks that print on a line.</p>
