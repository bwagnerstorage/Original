  <h1>Data and Computers</h1>
  <p>A computer can be defined as a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data.
     Without data, computers would be useless. Every task a computer undertakes deals with
     managing data in some way.</p>
  <p>In the not-so-distant past, computers dealt almost exclusively with numeric and textual data.
     Today, however, computers are truly multimedia devices, dealing with a vast array of
     information categories. Computers store, present, and help us modify different types of data:</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
    <ul>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>Text</li>
      <li>Images and graphics</li>
      <li>Audio</li>
      <li>Video</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Ultimately, all of this data is stored in the computer as binary digits. Each document,
     picture, and sound bite is somehow represented as a series of 1s and 0s. In this lesson we focus on how
     these different types of data are represented in the computer.</p>
   <h1>Analog and Digital Data</h1>
  <p>The natural world, for the most part, is continuous and infinite. A number line is continuous, with values
     growing infinitely large and small. That is, you can always come up with a number that is larger or smaller
     than any given number. The world, however, is not just infinite in a mathematical sense. For example, the 
     spectrum of colors is a continuous rainbow of infinite shades.</p>
  <p>Computers, by contrast, are finite. Computer memory and other hardware devices have only so much room to
     store and manipulate a certain amount of data. The difficultly comes when we attempt to
     represent an infinite world on a finite machine. The goal, then, is to represent enough of the world to 
     satisfy our computational needs and our senses of sight and sound. We want to make our representations
     good enough to get the job done, whatever that job might be.</p>
  <p>Data can be represented in one of two ways: analog or digital. <strong>Analog data</strong> is a continuous representation,
     analogous to the actual information it represents. <strong>Digital data</strong> is a discrete representation, breaking
     the information up into separate elements.</p>
  <p>A mercury thermometer is an example of an analog device. The mecury rises in a continuous flow in the tube in direct proportion
     to the temperature.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Analog data is directly proportional to the continuous, infinite world around us. Computers, therefore, cannot work well
     with analog data. Instead, we <strong>digitize</strong> data by breaking it into pieces and representing those pieces
     separately. These pieces are then individually represented using binary digits.</p>
  <p>But why do we use the binary number system? You know from an earlier lesson that binary is just one of many equivalent
     number systems. Couldn't we use, say, the decimal number system, with which we are already more familiar? We could.
     In fact, it's been done. Computers have been built that are based on other number systems. However, modern computers are
     designed to use and manage binary values because the devices that store and manage the data are far less expensive and 
     far more reliable if they have to represent only one of two possible values.</p>
  <p>Also, electronic signals are far easier to maintain if they transfer only binary data. An analog signal continually
     fluctuates up and down in voltage, but a digital signal has only as a high or low state, corresponding to the two
     binary digits.</p>
