  <h1>Representing Color</h1>
  <p>Color is our perception of the various frequencies of light that reach the retinas of
     ours eyes. Our retinas have three types of color photoreceptor cone cells that respond
	 to different sets of frequencies. These photoreceptor categories correspond to the
	 colors of red, green, and blue. All other colors perceptible by the human eye can be
	 made by combining various amounts of these three colors.</p>
  <p>In a computer, color is often expressed as an RGB (Red-Green-Blue) value, which is
     actually three numbers that indicate the relative contribution of each of these
	 primary colors. If each number in the triple is given on a scale of 0 to 255, then
	 0 means no contribution of that color and 255 means full contribution of that color.
	 For example, an RGB value of (255, 255, 0) maximizes the contribution of red and green
	 and minimizes the contribution of blue, which results in a bright yellow.</p>
  <p>The app below demonstrates how RGB values are used to create colors on your screen.
     Use the sliders to change the contribution of each color. </p>

  <p>The amount of data that is used to represent a color is called the <strong>color depth.</strong>
     Most modern computers use a color depth of 24 bits called TrueColor. With this scheme, each number
	 in an RGB value gets 8 bits, which gives the range of 0 to 255 for each. This results
	 in the ability to represent more than 16.7 million unique colors.</p>
  <p>No one really knows exactly how many colors the human eye can see. Researches have 
     estimated it to by around 10 million, therefore the 24 bit scheme actually provides
	 more colors than the human eye can distinguish.</p>
  <h1>Digitized Images and Graphics</h1>
  <p>A photograph is an analog representation of an image. It is continuous across its surface,
     with shades of one color blending into another. Digitizing a picture is the act of 
	 representing it as a collection of individual dots called <strong>pixels</strong>. 
	 Each pixel is composed of a single color. The number of pixels used to represent a picture is 
	 called the <strong>resolution.</strong> If enough pixels are used (high resolution), and are 
	 then presented in the proper order side by side, the human eye can be fooled into thinking it's
	 viewing a continuous picture.</p>
	<center><img src="images/raster1.jpg"></center> 
  <p>The storage of image information on a pixel-by-pixel basis is called a <strong>raster-graphics format.</strong>
     Several popular raster-graphics file formats are currently in use, including bitmap(BMP),
	 GIF, PNG, and JPEG.</p>
  <p>The BMP file format contains the pixel color values of the image from left to right and
     from top to bottom. A bitmap file supports 24-bit TrueColor, although usually the color
	 depth can be specified to reduce the file size.</p>
  <p>The GIF format limits the number of available colors in the image to 256. That is, a GIF image
     can be made up of only 256 colors, but each GIF image can be made up of different set of
	 256 colors. This technique, called <strong>indexed color</strong>, results in smaller
	 file sizes because there are fewer colors to reference. GIF files are best used for graphics
	 and images with few colors, and are therefore considered optimal for line art.</p>
  <p>The PNG (pronounded "ping") format was designed to improve upon, and ultimately replace,
     the GIF format. PNG images can usually achieve a greater compression than GIF's, while
	 offering a much wider range of color depths.</p>
  <p>The JPEG format is designed to exploit the nature of our eyes. Humans are more sensitive to
     gradual changes of brightness and color over distance than we are to rapid changes.
	 Therefore, the data that the JPEG format stores averages out the color hues over short
	 distances. This format is considered superior for photographic color images. A fairly
	 complicated compression scheme can significantly reduce the resulting file sizes.</p>
  <h1>Vector Representation of Graphics</h1>
  <p><strong>Vector graphics</strong> is another technique for representing images. Instead
     of assigning colors to pixels as we do in raster graphics, a vector-graphics format
	 describes an image in terms of lines and geometric shapes. A vector graphic is a series
	 of commands that describe a line's direction, thickness, and color. The file sizes
	 produced with these formats tend to by small because every pixel does not have to be
	 accounted for. The complexity of the image, such as the number of items in the picture,
	 determines the file size.</p>
  <p>Vector graphics is not good for representing real-world images. JPEG images are far superior
     in that regard, but vector graphics is good for line art and cartoon-style drawings. The most
	 popular vector-graphics format used on the Web today is called <strong>Flash</strong>.</p>
