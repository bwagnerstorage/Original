  <h1>Representing Video</h1>
  <p>Video information is one of the most complex types of information to capture, compress,
     and still get a result that makes sense to the human eye. Video clips contain the
	 equivalent of many still images, each of which must be compressed.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/youtube-logo.png"></div>
  <h1>Video Codecs</h1>
  <p>Codec stands for COmpressor/DECompressor. A <strong>video codec</strong> refers to methods
     used to shrink the size of a movie so that it can be played on a computer or over a
	 network. Almost all video codecs use lossy compression to minimize the huge amounts of
	 data associated with video. The goal, therefore, is not to lose information that affects
	 the viewer's senses.</p>
  <p>Most codecs are block oriented, meaning that each frame of a video is divided into
     rectangular blocks. The various codecs differ in how the blocks are encoded. Some video
	 codecs are accomplished completely in software, whereas others require special hardware.</p>
  <p>Various video codecs are popular today, including Sorenson, Cinepak, MPEG, Windows Media Video,
     and Real Video. The details of how these codecs represent and compress video are beyond the scope of
	 our discussion.</p>
