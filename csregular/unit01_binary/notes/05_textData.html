  <h1>Representing Text</h1>
  <p>As we have seen, all numbers whether integers or real numbers are represented in the
     computer as binary numbers. But what about text? How does the computer represent
	 things like the letter 'A' or a comma? Well, it turns out they are also stored
	 as binary numbers. Every character you see on a keyboard including uppercase letters, 
	 lowercase letters, numeric characters ('0'-'9'), punctuation markers, and other special
	 keys like the enter key, space bar, etc. have been digitized which means they have been
	 assigned a number.</p>
   <p>A <strong>character set</strong> is a list of characters and the codes used to represent each one.
      In this lesson we explore two character sets: ASCII and Unicode.</p>
	  
    <h1>The ASCII Character Set</h1>
	
  <p>ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. The 
    ASCII character set was originally adopted in 1963 and was based on the English 
    alphabet. This code has seen several revisions but is currently an eight-bit 
    (byte) scheme which allows for 256 unique characters which includes accented 
    letters as well as several other special symbols. The chart below shows the 
    first 128 characters in the set.</p>

  <p>The first 32 characters in the ASCII chart are not visible on a computer screen. These
     characters are for special purposes, such as carriage return and tab.</p>
  <h1>The Unicode Character Set</h1>
	<p></p>
	
	
  <p>The ASCII character set provides 256 characters, which is enough for English 
    but not enough for international use. This limitation gave rise to the Unicode
	character set, which has a much stronger international influence.</p>
   
  <p>The goal of the people who created Unicode is nothing less than to represent 
    every character in every language used in the entire world, including all 
    of the Asian ideograms. It also represents many special-purpose characters 
    such as scientific symbols.</p>
   
  <p>The Unicode character set was originally a 16 bit scheme, however, the character 
    set is still evolving and is no longer restricted to 16 bits. For consistency, 
    Unicode was designed to be a superset of ASCII. That is, the first 256 characters 
    in the Unicode character set correspond exactly to the extended ASCII character 
    set, including the codes used to represent them.</p>
