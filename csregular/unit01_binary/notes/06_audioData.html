  <h1>Representing Audio</h1>
<p>We perceive sound when a series of air compressions vibrate a membrane in our ear,
   which sends signals to our brain. Thus a sound is defined in nature by the wave
   of air that interacts with our eardrum. To represent a sound, we must somehow 
   represent the appropriate sound wave.</p>
<p>A stereo sends an electrical signal to a speaker to produce sound. This signal is
   an analog representation of the sound wave. The voltage in the signal varies in
   direct proportion to the sound wave. The speaker receives the signal and causes
   a membrane to vibrate, which in turn vibrates the air(creating a sound wave), 
   which in turn vibrates the eardrum. The created sound wave should ideally be
   identical to the one that was captured initially, or at least good enough to 
   please the listener.</p>
<p>To represent audio data on a computer, we must digitize the sound wave, somehow
   breaking it into discrete, manageable pieces. One way to accomplish this task
   is to actually digitize the analog representation of the sound. That is, we
   can take the electrical signal that represents the sound wave and represent it
   as a series of discrete numeric values.</p>
<p>An analog signal varies in voltage continously. To digitize the signal, we
   periodically measure the voltage of the signal and record the appropriate numeric
   value. The process is called <strong>sampling</strong>. Instead of a continuous
   signal, we end up with a series of numbers representing distinct voltage levels.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/audio1.jpg"></div>
<p>To reproduce the sound wave, we use the stored voltage values to create a new
   continuous electrical signal. The assumption is that the voltage levels in the
   original signal changed evenly between one stored voltage value and the next. If
   we take enough samples in a short period of time, that assumption is reasonable.
   But certainly the process of samplings can lose information.</p>
<p>In general a sampling rate of around 40,000 times per second is enough to create
   a reasonable sound reproduction. If the sampling rate is much lower than that,
   the human ear begins to hear distortions. As higher sampling rate produces
   better-quality sound, but after a certain point the extra data is irrelevant
   because the human ear can't hear the difference. The overall result is affected
   by many factors, including the quality of the equipment, the type of sound, and
   the human listener.</p>
<p>A compact disc (CD) stores audio information digitally. On the surface of the CD
   are microscopic pits that represent binary digits. A low-intensity laser is pointed
   at the disc. The laser light reflects strongly if the surface is smooth and
   reflects poorly if the surface is pitted. A receptor analyzes the reflection and
   produces the appropriate string of binary data, which represents the numeric
   voltage values that were stored when the signal was digitized. The signal is 
   reproduced and sent to the speaker.</p>

<h1>Audio Formats</h1>
<p>Over the past few years, several formats for audio data have become popular,
   including WAV, AU, AIFF, VQF, and MP3. All of these formats as based on the storage
   of voltage values sampled from analog signals, but all recognize the details
   of the data in different ways and all use various compression techniques to
   one extent or another.</p>
<p>Currently, the dominant format for compressing audio data is MP3. The popularity
   of MP3 resulted mostly because it offered a stronger compression ratio than other
   formats available at the time. Other formats may prove more efficient in the future,
   but for now MP3 is the general favorite.</p>
