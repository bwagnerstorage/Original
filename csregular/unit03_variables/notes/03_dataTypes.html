  <h1>Integer Types</h1>
  <p>There are four types of variables that you can use to store integer data. 
     All of these are signed, that is they can store both negative and positive values. 
	 The four integer types differ in the range of values they can store, so the choice
	 of type for a variable depends on the range of data values you are likely to need.</p>

<p>*The data types highlighted in red are the ones we will be using in the course. </p>
<p>In most situations, the <strong>int</strong> type is the most practical. If you want to represent the
   number of inhabitants of our planet, you'll need to resort to a long. The byte and 
   short types are mainly intended for specialized applications and we will not be using
   them in the programs we write.</p>
<h3>Integer Values</h3>
<p>An integer variable stores an integer value, so before we get to use integer variables
   we need to investigate how we write various integer values. First we need to define a
   new term. <strong>Literals</strong> are items in a program whose values do not change. A value of any 
   kind in Java is referred to as a literal. So 2, 10.5 and "This is text" are all examples
   of literals.</p>
<p>Any integer literal that you specify is of type <strong>int</strong> by default. 
   Thus 4, -9999, 123456789 are all literals of type int. If you want to define an integer
   of type long, and the value that you assign to the variable is bigger than an int, you 
   need to append an L to the value. The values 1L, -9999L and 123456789L are all of type long.
   Below is an example.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class SampleProgram
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      long num1 = 500;  <div id="csComment"><pre>// 500 is smaller than 2,147,483,647 so L not required</pre></div>
      long num2 = 5000000000<div id="csHighlight"><pre>L</pre></div>; <div id="csComment"><pre>// 5 billion is larger than 2,147,483,647 
	                       // so L is required</pre></div>
	  
   }
}
<div id="csComment"><pre>// 500 and 5000000000 are both integer literals by default. 
// Since 500 does not excede  the maximum size of an integer
// value (2,147, 483, 647) it needs no modifications.
// However since 5000000000 is larger than the maximum integer
// value it must by convert to a long value by appending the
// letter L to the end.</pre></div>
</pre>
  </div>
<h1> Floating-Point Values</h1>
<p>Numeric values which are not integral (integers) are stored as floating point numbers.
   There are two basic floating point types in Java, float and double. These give you a
   choice in the number of digits precision available to represent your data values, and
   thus, in the range of values that can be accommodated:</p>
   <table id="csTable" width="80% align="center">
        <tr> 
          <th width="9%" class="notes">Type</th>
          <th width="25%" class="notes">Memory Requirements</th>
          <th width="66%" class="notes">Range of Values</th>
        </tr>
		<tr> 
          <td class="notes"><div align="center">float</div></td>
          <td class="notes"> <div align="center">4 bytes</div></td>
		  <td class="notes"> <div align="center">approximately &plusmn;3.402823 E +38<br> (7 significant decimal digits) </div></td>
        </tr>
		<tr> 
          <td class="notes"><div align="center"><font color="#FF0000">double</font></div></td>
          <td class="notes"> <div align="center">8 bytes</div></td>
		  <td class="notes"> <div align="center">approximately &plusmn;1.79769313486232 E +308 <br>(15 significant decimal digits)</div></td>
        </tr>
        </tr>
      </table>
	<p>*The data type highlighted in red is the one we will be using in the course.</p>
	<p>The name <strong>double</strong> refers to the fact that these numbers have twice the precision of the
	   float type. Here, the type to choose in most applications is double. The limited precision
	   of float is simply not sufficient for many situations. Seven significant (decimal) digits
	   may be enough to precisely express the money in your savings account in dollars and cents,
	   but it won't be enough for someone like Bill Gates. The only reason to use float is in the
	   rare situations in which the slightly faster processing of single-precision numbers is 
	   important, or when you need to store a large number of them.</p>
	<p>When you need to write very large or very small floating point values, you will usually 
	   want to write them with an exponent - that is, as a decimal value multiplied by a power
	   of 10. You can do this in Java by writing the number as decimal value followed by an E,
	   or e, preceding the power of 10 that you require. For example, the distance of the earth
	   to the sun is approximately 149,600,000 kilometers, more conveniently written as 1.496E8.
	   At the opposite end of the scale, the mass of an electron is around 0.000000000000000000009
	   grams. This is much more convenient, not to say more readable, when it is written as 9.0E-28
	   grams.</p>
	<h3>Declaring Floating Point Variables</h3>
    <p>You declare floating point variables in a similiar way to that we've already
	   used for integers. We can declare and intialize a variable of type double with
	   the statement:</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
double sunDistance = 149600000;</pre>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
double sunDistance = 1.496E8;</pre>
</div>
<h1>Character Type</h1>
<p>The <strong>char</strong> data type is used to represent Unicode character values. Character literal values are contained
   within single quotes. Examples: 'a', 'B', ':', '5'. This is in contrast to string literals which are contained within
   double quotes. Examples: "a", "dog", "1234", "Have a nice day!". The difference between character data and string
   data is that character data can only be a single character whereas string data can be single or multiple characters.
   A string is a "string of characters".</p>
   <p>You can define a char variable, called ch, with the statement:</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
char ch = 'm';</pre>
</div>
<h1>Boolean Type</h1>
<p>Variables that can only have one of two values, true or false, are of type boolean,
   and the values true and false are Boolean literals. You can define a boolean variable,
   called state, with the statement:</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
boolean state = true;</pre>
</div>
<p>This statement also initializes the variable state with the value true. You can also set
   a boolean variable in an assignment statement. For example, the statement,
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
state = false;</pre>
</div>
 
<p>sets the value of the variable state to false.</p>
<p>At this point we can't do much with a <strong>boolean</strong> variable, other than to set its value to
   true or false, but, as you will see later, Boolean variables become much more useful in
   the context of decision making in a program, particularly when we can use expressions 
   that produce a boolean result.</p>
