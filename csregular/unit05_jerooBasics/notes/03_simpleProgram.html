  <h1>Simple Program</h1>
  <p>This section provides an introduction to the process of writing a Jeroo program. We introduce the form of a program,
     the possible ways to instantiate (create) a Jeroo, and the basic actions that every Jeroo understands.</p>
 <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
  <p>At one level, a Jeroo program is just a text file, but one with identifiable parts. The largest parts are called
     methods. The body of each method consists of comments, blank lines, action statements, and control structures.</p>
  <p>Jeroo's Java style programming language is case-sensitive. This means that upper-case and lower-case letters are 
     considered to be different from one another. We need to be careful and consistent whenever we type the source code
     for a Jeroo program.</p>
  <p>It's not enough to write a program that solves the intended problem. The program's logic must be well designed, 
     and it must be easy for someone to read and understand the program's source code. Whitespace, comments, and descriptive
	 identifiers all contribute to making a program easier to read.</p>
  <p>Whitespace consists of blank lines, spaces, tabs, and newline (end-of-line characters). Blank lines should be used to
     organize the parts of the source code into groups that correspond to the logic of the algorithm. Indentations using
	 tabs or spaces should be used to show the extent of methods and control structures. Spaces should be used to help a
	 reader see the important parts of a line of source code. A newline (press Enter or Return on the keyboard) should be
	 used at the end of every statement, to break up long statements into smaller parts, and to help show the major parts
	 of the code. The recommended way to use whitespace will be demonstrated in the examples, and discussed as necessary.</p>
  <p>Comments are phrases that a programmer inserts into a program to provide additional information for anyone who reads
     the program. Comments are ignored when the program is executed (run). A comment in Jeroo's Java style language begins
	 with the digraph // and continues until the end of the line.</p>
 <h1>Form of a Jeroo Program</h1>
  <p>Methods are the primary components of a Jeroo program. Every Jeroo program must have exactly one main method, and it may
     contain any number of programmer-defined Jeroo methods. Programmer-defined Jeroo methods are discussed in later unit.</p>
  <p>The main method describes how to use one or more Jeroos to solve a specific problem. The form of the main method is shown
     in the figure below. Everything that appears between the braces should be indented 2 or 3 spaces.</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>
method main()
{

}
</pre></div>
<p> * The Jeroo main method is simplier than the Java main method.</p>
 <h1>Declaring and Instantiating Jeroos</h1>
  <p>Every Jeroo program uses from one to four Jeroo objects to solve a problem. The first part of the main method must be
     used to declare and instantiate all the Jeroos that will be used by the program. The syntax of this statement is shown
	 below. There are two parts to the statement, the declaration and the instantiation</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/instantiate.gif"></div>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>
Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();
</pre></div>
 <h3>Declaration Portion</h3>
  <p>The declaration portion indicates that the programmer plans to use a Jeroo to help solve the problem. The programmer must
     provide an identifier (or name) for the Jeroo object. The following box contains the rules for creating identifiers in 
	 Jeroo's programming language.</p>
 <div id="csList">
    <ul>
	  <li>The first character must be a letter, a dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).</li>
	  <li>The remaining characters can be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores.</li>
	  <li>There is no limit on the length of an identifier.</li>
	</ul></div>
 <h3>Instantiation Portion</h3>
  <p>The instantiation portion is a request that the Jeroo object be created. The crucial part of the instantiation is the
     constructor, which has the form Jeroo(...). The parentheses are to be filled in with initial values of the attributes for
	 that Jeroo object. Every Jeroo object has three attributes: its location, its direction, and the number of flowers in its
	 pouch. If we choose not to specify an initial value for one or more of the attributes, the constructor provides default 
	 values as shown in table below.</p>
  <table id="csTable">
    <tr>
	   <th width="150">Attribute</th>
	   <th width="120">Default</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td><div align="center">Location</div></td>
	   <td><div align="center">(0,0)</div></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td><div align="center">Direction</div></td>
	   <td><div align="center">EAST</div></td>
	</tr>
  	<tr>
	   <td><div align="center">Flowers</div></td>
	   <td><div align="center">0</div></td>
	</tr>
  </table>
  <p>As a convenience, the Jeroo language contains six different constructors, all but one of which allows us to provide values
     for just some of the attributes. Default values will be provided for the others. The constructors are summarized below.</p>
  <table id="csTable">
    <tr>
	   <th>Examples</th>
	   <th>Attributes</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>//---Accept all defaults ---<br>
            Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo();</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
             Location: (0,0)<br>
             Direction: EAST<br>
             Flowers: 0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>//--- Specify just the flowers ---<br>
            Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(8);</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
            Location: (0,0)<br>
            Direction: EAST<br>
            Flowers: 8</td>
	</tr>
  	<tr>
	   <td>//--- Specify just the location ---<br>
            Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(3,4);</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
              Location: (3,4)<br>
              Direction: EAST<br>
              Flowers: 0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>//--- Specify location and direction ---<br>
            Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(3,4,WEST);</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
             Location: (3,4)<br>
             Direction: WEST<br>
             Flowers: 0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>//--- Specify location and flowers ---<br>
            Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(3,4,8);</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
             Location: (3,4)<br>
             Direction: EAST<br>
             Flowers: 8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>//--- Specify all attributes ---<br>
           Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(3,4,SOUTH,8);</td>
	   <td>Name: jessica<br>
            Location: (3,4)<br>
            Direction: SOUTH<br>
            Flowers: 8</td>
	</tr>
  </table>
   <p>The equal sign between the declaration and instantiation portions indicates that the newly created
      Jeroo object is to be associated with the identifier in the declaration portion.</p>
	  
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
Jeroo bob = new Jeroo(5, 6, SOUTH, 10);   
</pre></div>
<p> * bob starts at location (5,6), facing SOUTH, with 10 flowers in pouch</p>
  <h1>Action Statements</h1>
   <p>An action statement is a request that a Jeroo perform a specific task. That task can be either one of the
      basic action methods that are part of the Jeroo language or a Jeroo method that has been written by the
	  programmer. The syntax of an action statement is shown below.</p>
    <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/actionStatements.gif"></div>
	
	<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>
Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();
bob.hop();
bob.turn(LEFT);
</pre></div>
	
   <p>The Jeroo language includes the seven action methods shown in table below. Three of these, give, turn,
      and one version of hop require an argument value.</p>
   <table id="csTable">
    <tr>
	   <th>Method</th>
	   <th>Purpose</th>
	   <th>Example</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>hop()</div></td>
	   <td>Hop one space ahead.
           The program terminates with an error condition if the hopping Jeroo lands in the water, lands on another Jeroo, or hops onto a net.
           A Jeroo can hop onto a flower.</td>
	   <td>jessica.hop();</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>hop(number)</td>
	   <td>Hop number times in a row, where number is a positive integer.</td>
	   <td>jessica.hop(3);
           jessica.hop(12);</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>pick()</td>
	   <td>Pick a flower from the current location. Nothing happens if there is no flower at the current location.</td>
	   <td>jessica.pick();</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>plant()</td>
	   <td>Plant a flower at the current location.
           Nothing happens if the Jeroo does not have a flower to plant.</td>
	   <td>jessica.plant();</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>toss()</td>
	   <td>Toss a flower one space ahead.
           The tossed flower is lost forever.
           If the flower lands on a net, the net is disabled.</td>
	   <td>jessica.toss();</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>turn(relativeDirection)</td>
	   <td>Turn in the indicated direction<br>
           [ turn(AHEAD) and turn(HERE) are meaningless ]</td>
	   <td>jessica.turn(LEFT);
           jessica.turn(RIGHT);</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	   <td>give(relativeDirection)</td>
	   <td>Give a flower to a Jeroo in a neighboring cell in the indicated direction. 
	       Nothing happens if the giving Jeroo has no flowers or if there is no Jeroo in the indicated direction.<br>
           [give(HERE) is meaningless ]</td>
	   <td>jessica.give(LEFT);
           jessica.give(RIGHT);</td>
	</tr>

  <h1>Example - Pick and Plant</h1>
  <p>This section contains an extended example that demonstrates a recommended process for converting an algorithm into completed source code.
     The problem statement and the detailed algorithm are repeated here for your convenience.</p>
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/pickandplant.gif"></div>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Detailed Algorithm</h3>
  <p>Let's name the jeroo Bobby.<br>
     Bobby should do the following<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the flower<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop 3 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick the flower<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the flower<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn right<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop 2 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant a flower<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop East<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn left<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop once</p>
  <h3>Jeroo Code for "Pick and Plant"</h3>
  <p>A good programmer doesn't write a program all at once. Instead, the programmer will write and test the program in a series of builds.
     Each build adds to the previous one. The high-level algorithm will guide us in this process.</p>
  <h3>FIRST BUILD</h3>
  <p>The recommended first build contains three things.</p>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
	   <li>The main method</li>
       <li>Declaration and instantiation of every Jeroo that will be used</li>
       <li>The high-level algorithm in the form of comments.</li></ul></div> 
    <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/ppBuild1.gif"></div>
  <p>Once the first build is working correctly, we can proceed to the others. In this case, each build will correspond to one step
     in the high-level algorithm. It may seem like a lot of work to use four builds for such a simple program, but doing so helps
     establish habits that will become invaluable as the programs become more complex.</p>
 <h3>BUILD 2</h3>
  <p>This build adds the logic to "get the flower". The blank lines help show the organization of the logic.
     The new code is shown in boldface type.</p>
	 <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/ppBuild2.gif"></div>
  <h3>BUILD 3</h3>
  <p>This build adds the logic to "put the flower". The new code is shown in boldface type.</p>
	 <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/ppBuild3.gif"></div>
  <h3>BUILD 4(Final)</h3>
  <p>This build adds the logic to "hop East". The new code is shown in boldface type.</p>
	 <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/ppBuild4.gif"></div>
<br>
</div>
