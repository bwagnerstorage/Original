  <h1>Essential Concepts</h1>
  <p>The Jeroo language is a small object-oriented programming language. We will use the Jeroo language to write programs that
     control up to four jeroos. This lesson describes several general concepts about object-oriented programs. As you read 
	 subsequent lessons, refer back to this lesson to review the meaning of important words and phrases.</p>
 <h1>Programs and Programming Languages</h1>
  <p>It doesn't matter whether we are sending email, surfing the net, listening to music, writing an essay, or playing a game,
     whenever we use a computer we are using one or more computer programs. Each program is simply a set of instructions for 
	 the computer.</p>
  <div id="jerooNote">A computer <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions for a computer.</div>
  <p>Every program is written by one or more programmers. Programmers use a programming language such as Java, C++, Python, 
     or Visual Basic to write a computer program. Programs exist in many forms. The form that a programmer writes is called
	 the source code for the program. Unfortunately, a computer cannot use source code directly. Source code must be translated
	 into machine language before it can be executed (run) by the computer.</p>
  <div id="jerooNote">The <strong>source code</strong> for a program is written by a programmer in some programming language.</div>
  <p>There are several kinds of translation. A compiler translates a program, as a whole, from one form into another, but not
     necessarily into machine language. An interpreter translates a program into machine language one statement at a time. 
	 Each statement is executed as soon as it has been translated.</p>
  <div id="jerooNote">A <strong>compiler</strong> translates a program, as a whole, from one form to another.<br>
     An <strong>interpreter</strong> translates a program into machine language one statement at a time. </div>
  <p>Both Java and Jeroo use a two-step approach to translating source code into machine language. First, a compiler translates
     the source code into an intermediate language. Second, an interpreter translates the intermediate language into executable
	 instructions. In the case of Java, this intermediate language is called Java Byte Code, and the interpreter is called the
	 Java Virtual Machine. </p>
 <h1>Algorithms</h1>
  <p>Every computer program starts with a plan. That plan is called an algorithm. There are many ways to write an algorithm.
     Some are very informal, some are quite formal and mathematical in nature, and some are quite graphical. The form is not
	 particularly important as long as it provides a good way to describe and check the logic of the plan. </p>
  <div id="jerooNote">An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a plan for solving a problem. </div>
 <h1>Case-Sensitive Language</h1>
  <p>In Jeroo's Java/C++/C#-style programming language, upper-case letters and lower-case letters are treated as being different
     from one another. For example, the words "jessica", "Jessica", and "JESSICA" are treated as three different names. Other
	 languages might treat these as being the same. </p>
  <div id="jerooNote">A language that treats upper-case and lower-case letters as being different from one another is said to
     be <strong>case-sensitive</strong>.</div>
 <h1>Syntax and Semantics</h1>
  <p>Every language, whether it is a natural language such as English or a programming language such as Java, has a vocabulary,
     a syntax, and a semantic meaning. </p>
 <div id="jerooNote"><strong>Syntax</strong> is a set of rules for writing or speaking that language.<br>
     The meaning associated with valid expressions is known as the <strong>semantics</strong> of the expression.</div>
  <p>Examples One syntax rule is that the symbol "?" must appear at the end of a question in written English. The sentences
     "The balls bounce." and "Bounce the balls." use the same words and punctuation, but have different semantics (different meanings). </p>
 <h1>Object</h1>
  <p>It should come as no surprise to learn that an object-oriented programming language works with objects. But, what is an object? 
     Unfortunately, this concept is difficult to define because an object is simultaneously something that only exists within a 
	 computer program and a logical representation of something else. A good approach is to define an object in terms of what it represents.</p>
  <div id="jerooNote">An <strong>object</strong> represents a specific concept or item that is relevant to the problem we are trying to solve.</div>
  <p>A typical program works with several different objects. Some of these may represent the same kind of thing. For example, 
     suppose our problem were to manage the rental of books to students. We would likely have some objects that represent the 
	 books and others that represent the students. Now, if Kim were to rent "Haiku and You" and "Cooking with Mystery Meat", 
	 we might have two objects, one for each of these books.</p>
  <p>The Jeroo programming language only supports one kind of object - the Jeroo, but a single program can work with as many
     as four Jeroo objects. These objects should work together to solve a problem. </p>
  <p>An object represents something, but we, as programmers, need to determine what characteristics of that thing are important
     to the problem we are trying to solve. There are two parts to an object, facts about the thing it represents and tasks that
	 the object can perform. The facts are called attributes, and the tasks are called methods.</p>
 <h1>Attribute</h1>
  <p>When designing an object to represent something, we must select facts about that thing that are relevant to the problem we
     are trying to solve. For example, the title of a book would be important to a bookstore, but not to the company that shipped
	 the book from the publisher's warehouse. On the other hand, the weight of the book would be important to the shipper, but not
	 to the bookstore. Facts such as the title or weight of a book are called attributes. </p>
   <div id="jerooNote">An <strong>attribute</strong> is a fact associated with a specific object.</div>
   <p>The attributes of a Jeroo object include its location, the number of flowers in its pouch, and the direction it's facing.</p>
  <h1>Methods and Behaviors </h1>
   <p>When we design an object, we need to determine what tasks it should perform. In doing so, we tend to anthropomorphize the
      item that the object represents. (To anthropomorphize means to ascribe human characteristics to non-human things.)
	  For example, we might want a book to tell us its price or to display a picture of its cover on the screen. A behavior is
	  an action that an object can take or a task that it can perform in response to a request from an external source.</p>
   <div id="jerooNote">A <strong>method</strong> is a collection of statements that are written in some programming language to describe a specific behavior.</div>
   <div id="jerooNote">A <strong>precondition</strong> for a method is something that is assumed to be true before the method is invoked.<br>
	  A <strong>postcondition</strong> for a method is something that is assumed to be true after the method has been executed.</div>
   <p>All Jeroo objects share the same set of behaviors. There is a set of predefined behaviors, but the language allows us to
      write methods that define additional behaviors.</p>
  <h1>Message (Invoking a Method)</h1>
   <p>When we write an object-oriented program, we instantiate appropriate objects, and ask them to perform specific tasks. 
      We use messages to make these requests. </p>
   <div id="jerooNote">A message is a request for a specific object to perform a specific task.</div>
   <p>When we ask an object to perform a task, we say that we are sending a message or invoking the method that describes the task.</p>
  <h1>Classes and Instantiation</h1>
   <p>A programmer must determine which objects are relevant to the problem being solved and the attributes and behaviors of those
      objects. These attributes and behaviors must be written in a programming language. </p>
   <div id="jerooNote">A <strong>class</strong> is a collection of statements that are written in some programming language to describe both the attributes and behaviors of an object.</div>
   <p>A class is similar to a recipe for a cake or a blueprint for a house. Many people view a class as being a template for creating an object.
      When we write an object-oriented program, we need to create specific objects as defined by the statements in the class. 
	  We "bake" to create a cake, we "build" to create a house, and we "instantiate" to create on object within a computer program. 
   <div id="jerooNote">The process of creating a specific object is called <strong>instantiation</strong>.</div>
   <p>All objects that have been instantiated from the same class have the same behaviors, but usually have different values for
      their attributes. For example, two different book objects usually have different ISBN numbers. 
      Most object-oriented programs use two types of classes. Programmer-defined classes are ones that have been written by the
	  programmer as part of the solution to a problem. Predefined classes have been purchased separately or are part of the 
	  programming language, itself. 
      The Jeroo language only supports a single predefined class - the Jeroo class. We can instantiate up to four Jeroos from this class.</p>
