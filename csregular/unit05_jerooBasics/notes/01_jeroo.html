  <h1>Jeroo's World</h1>
  <p>Santong island is an uninhabited speck of land in the South Pacific Ocean. In the late 1980's, naturalist Jessica Tong
     discovered two previously unknown species that are unique to this island. One is the jeroo, a rare mammal similar to the
	 wallabies of Australia. The other is the large winsum flower that is the jeroo's primary food source.</p>
  <p>Like its distant Australian relative, the jeroo moves by hopping, but its movements are unique in all of nature. Each
     jeroo only moves in one of the four main compass directions, and only turns in 90<sup>o</sup> increments. This unusual behavior
	 continues to mystify Jessica and the few other researchers who have observed jeroos in the wild. Some believe that this
	 behavior is somehow related to geomagnetic forces, but others think that this is just a bizarre learned behavior.</p>
  <p>Every jeroo has a pouch, but the male's pouch is somewhat smaller. While the female uses her pouch to protect and 
     nurture her offspring, both sexes use their pouches to carry winsum flowers that they have picked.
     During the rainy season, January through December, sudden storms can create temporary lakes and rivers, or even alter
	 the shape of the island, itself. Despite living on Santong island for uncounted millennia, the jeroos are extremely
	 poor swimmers. While they are keenly aware of their immediate surroundings, jeroos can be careless. If one happens
	 to hop into the ocean, its fur becomes waterlogged, and it must rest in the sun for a few hours before resuming its
	 normal activity. In what can only be described as a telepathic connection, all other jeroos also cease their activities
	 until the wet jeroo has recovered.</p>
  <p>Until recently, the jeroos were safe from human interference because they were only known to a handful of researchers
     and because Santong island is very small, very remote, and missing from most maps. The jeroos' idyllic world was 
	 interrupted in 2001, when Brian arrived at the island. Brian is a renowned collector who was hired to capture a jeroo
	 for the extreme animal exhibit at Missouri's C. A. Baret zoo. Having studied the jeroos' unique patterns of movement,
	 Brian periodically sets nets in the locations that a jeroo is likely to visit. Fortunately, the sensitive jeroos can
	 detect his nets, and have learned that tossing a winsum flower onto a net will disable the net and make that location
	 safe for future travel. Brian can only catch a careless jeroo that leaps before it looks.</p>
 <h1>The Jeroo Simulator </h1>
  <p>After returning from a recent trip to Santong Island, Jessica asked her colleague, Deanna, to develop a simulator that
     could be used to demonstrate the jeroos and their relationship with their island. The result of Deanna's work is a
	 computer program, named Jeroo, and a Jeroo programming language that work together to help Jessica with her research.
	 The Jeroo language allows a programmer to direct the movements of up to four jeroos. The simulator contains a visual
	 component that allows one to see the results of running a Jeroo program.</p>
  <p>When Deanna designed the simulator, she used the jeroos' unique movements to model the island as a grid of rows and
     columns similar to a spreadsheet. There are 24 rows and 24 columns. The rows run East and West along lines of latitude,
	 and the columns run North and South along lines of longitude. Each element (cell) of this model corresponds to a 
	 location where a jeroo might land when it hops.</p>
  <p>Deanna chose to number both the rows and columns starting with zero at the northwest corner of the island. When asked
     why she started at zero, Deanna said that she was counting the number of safe hops from any location to the northwest
	 corner. </p>
  <p>We will use the notation (r,c) to indicate a specific cell, where r represents the row number of the cell, and c 
     represents its column number. For example, (4,5) indicates the cell in row number 4 and column number 5.</p>
