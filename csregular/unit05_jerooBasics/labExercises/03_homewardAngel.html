<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Angel is ready to leave school (location (0,0)) and head for home. Shortly before the last bell, 
     the students were cautioned about the possibility that a North-to-South line of nets had been placed
	 on the island. Write a program to get Angel from the East door of the school into his house of nets
	 in the Northeast portion of the island. Since Angel has no flowers at school, he must pick up a flower
	 on the way home, toss it into a net to get through the barrier, then go into the house.</p>
