  <h1>Scanner Class</h1>
  <p>The <strong>Scanner</strong> class is a standard Java class that can be used to read user input from the keyboard or a file. 
     The class contains several methods for reading user input from the keyboard. Right now we will only concern
	 ourselves with two of its methods: <strong>nextInt()</strong> and <strong>nextDouble()</strong>. Each of these methods will be demonstrated below.
	 Before we can use the Scanner class in our programs we must include the following import statement at the top of our program. </p>
  <div id="csCode">
     <pre>
import java.util.Scanner;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>The import statement instructs the compiler to give a program access to the 
    Scanner class. The words java and util in the statement are called packages 
    and we will talk more about that later. The important thing to remember here 
    is that if you want to use the Scanner class in your program you must include 
    the above line of code at the very top of your program. Once we have imported 
    the Scanner class into our program, we are ready to instaniate a Scanner object. 
    Look at the following code: </p>
  <div id="csCode">
     <pre>
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);</pre> </div>
  <p>The above code creates a <strong>Scanner object</strong> named <strong>keyboard</strong>. The name keyboard is arbitrary, you can name your objects
     anything you want as long as you follow the rules for declaring identifiers. It should, however, be a name that
	 actually describes what the object does. Since the Scanner object above is going to be reading user input from 
	 the keyboard, keyboard is a good choice for its name.</p>
  <p>The <strong>System.in</strong> you see in the parentheses tells the computer that you want to read from the standard input device - the keyboard.</p>
 <h1>nextInt() Method</h1>
  <p>The <strong>nextInt()</strong> method inables users to read integer values from the keyboard. Look at the code segment below:</p>
  <div id="csCode">
     <pre>
int num = keyboard.nextInt();</pre> </div>
  <p>In this statement, the keyboard object responds to the message <strong>nextInt</strong> by waiting for the user to type a number and
     then press the Enter key, at which point the keyboard object passes the typed number on to the program. The number
	 is then assigned to the variable num by means of the assignment operator (=). As the user types at the keyboard, 
	 the characters are automatically echoed in the console window, however it is not until the user presses the Enter
	 key that this input becomes available to the program.</p>
 <h3>print Statement</h3>
  <p>It is customary to precede each nextInt in your program with a user prompt. A <strong>user prompt</strong> is simply a statement that informs the user
     of the type of information they will be entering from the keyboard. For example, in the code below, I instruct the user to
	 "Enter the number of games played-->". This prompt tells the user what kind of information is required by the program to continue. </p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>print</pre></div>("Enter the number of games played--> ");    <div id="csComment"><pre>// user prompt</pre></div>
int games = keyboard.nextInt();</pre>
     </div>
  <p>The code above is introducing a new Java statement named <strong>print</strong>. You are already familiar with println statement. The difference between the
     print and the println statements is that the println moves the console cursor to the beginning of the next line after printing, whereas the print statement does not.
	 Therefore when using a print statement the next item printed will be on the same line as the previous item.</p>
  <p>The reason I used a print statement in the prompt, instead of the println, is so the user can enter the information on the same line
     as the prompt. Notice the output from the code above, the 5 entered by the user is on the same line as the prompt.</p>
<div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
Enter the number of games played--> 5</pre>
</div>
 <p>Lets look at a program that summarizes the steps involved in reading an integer from the console window:</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:680px">
    <pre>
import java.util.Scanner;  <div id="csComment"><pre>// Step 1: include an import statement at the top</pre></div>

public class ReadIntegers
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); <div id="csComment"><pre>// Step 2: instaniate Scanner object</pre></div>
      int num1 = 0, num2 = 0, num3 = 0;
      
      System.out.print("Enter 1st Number--> ");
      num1 = keyboard.nextInt();                   <div id="csComment"><pre>// Step 3: call nextInt() method</pre></div>
      System.out.print("Enter 2nd Number--> ");    <div id="csComment"><pre>//         and store the results </pre></div>
      num2 = keyboard.nextInt();                   <div id="csComment"><pre>//         in integer variables</pre></div>
      System.out.print("Enter 3rd Number--> ");
      num3 = keyboard.nextInt();
      
      System.out.println();
      System.out.println("Number 1 = " + num1);  <div id="csComment"><pre>// Step 4: use the integer variables</pre></div>
      System.out.println("Number 2 = " + num2);  <div id="csComment"><pre>//         in your program.</pre></div>
      System.out.println("Number 3 = " + num3);
   }
}</pre></div>
 <p>Here is sample run of the program above. Keep in mind that the numbers 10, 20, and 30 where entered from the
    keyboard while the program was running.</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
Enter 1st Number--> 10
Enter 2nd Number--> 20
Enter 3rd Number--> 30

Number 1 = 10
Number 2 = 20
Number 3 = 30</pre>
</div>
 <h1>nextDouble() Method</h1>
  <p>The <strong>nextDouble</strong> method is identical to the nextInt method except that it reads floating-point or decimal values
     from the keyboard instead of integers. Look at the following code segment:</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);       
double num = 0;                                  
                                                 
System.out.print("Enter a decimal number --> "); 
num = keyboard.nextDouble();                     <div id="csComment"><pre>// read decimal value from</pre></div>
                                                 <div id="csComment"><pre>// the keyboard</pre></div>
System.out.println();
System.out.println("The number entered = " + num);</pre></div>
  <p>Here is a sample output:</p>
   <div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
Enter a decimal number --> 3.14159

The number entered = 3.14159</pre>
</div>
  <p>Notice that the value entered from the keyboard (3.14159) is a floating-point number. You are not required to include
     the decimal point when entering values with nextDouble(). If you enter, for example, 300, the nextDouble method will
	 convert the number to 300.0 for you.</p>
