  <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
  <p>The high-level programming languages, developed to make the programming process easier, basically fall into
     two major groups, and these two groups utilize different approaches to programming. The first group, consisting
	 of the older languages (COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, C, and Pascal), uses what is called a <strong>procedural approach</strong>. 
	 Inadequacies in the procedural approach led to the development of the <strong>object-oriented approach</strong> and to several
	 newer languages (Smalltalk, C++, and Java). When you use a programming language that is not object oriented,
	 you must express the solution to every problem essentially in terms of numbers and characters - the basic kinds
	 of data that you can manipulate in the language. In an object-oriented language like Java, things are different.
	 Of course, you still have numbers and characters to work with - these are referred to as the basic or primitive
	 data types (int, double, char, boolean, etc.) - but you can define other kinds of entities that are relevant to
	 your particular problem. You solve your problem in terms of the entities or objects that occur in the context of
	 the problem. This not only affects how a program is structured, but also the terms in which the solution to your
	 problem is expressed. If your problem concerns baseball players, your Java program is likely to have BaseballPlayer
	 objects in it; if you are creating a game program that simulates a car race it will probably have Car objects.</p> 
  <p>Most programs in the real world contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Writing such programs is a highly
     complex task that can only be accomplished by breaking the code into communicating components. This is an application
	 of the well-known principle of "divide and conquer" that has been applied successfully to many human endeavors. 
	 There are various strategies for subdividing a program, and these depend on the type of programming language used.
	 We will now begin learning this process in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP) - that is, programming
	 with objects. </p>
<div id="csNote">In Java, almost everything is an object.</div>
 <h1>Classes and Objects</h1>
  <p>To begin with, you need to understand some of the terminology of OOP. The most important term is the <strong>class</strong>, 
     as you have already seen, all code that you write in Java is inside a class. A class is the template or blueprint
	 from which all <strong>objects</strong> are made. </p>
  <div id="csNote">A <strong>class</strong> is the template or blueprint from which all objects are made.</div>
  <p>A class is similiar to the primitive data types previously discussed, but there is one fundamental difference 
     between the two; a class includes more than just data. A class specifies what you can do with an object of the
	 class - that is, it defines the operations that are possible on objects of the class. In Java, these operations
	 are called <strong>methods</strong>.</p>
 <h3>Jeroo</h3>
  <p>Recall a familiar line of code in Jeroo:</p>
  <div id="csCode">
     <pre>
Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();</pre>
  </div>
  <div id="csNote">In OOP terminology you create an object by instantiating it.</div>
  <p>Once an object has been created, you can send messages to the object asking it to perform tasks using the methods
     that are defined within the class. Here are some examples:</p>
<div id="csCode">
     <pre>
bob.hop();
bob.turn(RIGHT);
bob.pick();
bob.toss();</pre>
  </div>
  <p>This same class-object relationship exists in Java.</p>
 <h1>Advantages of Using Objects</h1>
  <p>As mentioned previously, object-oriented programs are written using objects that are specific to the problem
     being solved. Your pinball machine simulator may well define and use objects of type Table, Ball, Flipper, and Bumper.
	 This has tremendous advantages, not only in terms of easing the development process, but also in any future expansion 
	 of such a program. Java provides a whole range of standard classes to help you in the development of your programs, 
	 classes for making buttons, menus, dialog boxes, and network access, just to name a few. You can also develop you own 
	 generic classes to provide a basis for developing programs that are of particular interest to you, but the details of 
	 that will be saved for a later unit.</p>
 <h1>Where to Begin</h1>
  <p>The easiest way to learn how to use classes and objects in your programs is use classes that have already been made.
     We will start with a class named <strong>Scanner</strong> which allows you to read information from the keyboard while viewing a console window.</p>
