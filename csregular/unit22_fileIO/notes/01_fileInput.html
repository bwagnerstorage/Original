<h1>Scanner Class</h1>
      <p>We have used the <strong>Scanner</strong> class to read user input from 
        the keyboard. The <em>Scanner</em> class can also be used to read input 
        from a file on an external storage device such as a hard disk or flash 
        drive. Conveniently the same methods used to retrieve information from 
        the keyboard can also be used to retrieve information from a file. Here 
        is a list of the <em>Scanner</em> methods we have used with some additional 
        methods that are more commonly used when reading from a file:</p>

      <h3>What is a Token</h3>
      <p> A <strong>token</strong> is a series of characters that ends with whitespace. 
        Whitespace includes one of the following: a blank space, a tab character, 
        a carriage return, or an end of the file marker. The scanner looks for 
        these tokens when it is reading from the input data and is able to segregate 
        them from each other. As an example, if we read a line that has a series 
        of numbers separated by blanks (whitespace), the scanner will read each 
        number as a separate token.</p>
<br>
      <h1>Reading from a File</h1>
      <p>To read information from a file you will need to do the following:</p>
      <h3>1) Step 1 - Import the Scanner and File classes</h3>
      <div id="csCode">
          <pre>import java.util.*;  <font color="#0000FF">// needed for Scanner</font>
import java.io.*;    <font color="#0000FF">// needed for File and FileNotFoundException</font>
</pre>
      </div>
      <h3>2) Step 2 - Instantiate a Scanner Object for File Input</h3>
      <div id="csCode">
    <pre>Scanner scan = new Scanner(new File(&quot;myFile.txt&quot;));
</pre>
</div>
      <p>Inorder to read from a file you must first tell the <em>Scanner</em> 
        object where the file is located. This is done by creating a <strong>File</strong> 
        object and including the name of the file as a parameter. In the example 
        above, the file is named &quot;myFile.txt&quot;. Since the <em>Scanner</em> 
        class only reads text files the file extension<strong> .txt</strong> is 
        often used as the file's extension name. Another common extension is <strong>.dat</strong>.</p>
      <div id="csNote">The data file must be located in the same folder 
              as the class file of the program that is reading the file. If you 
              want the file to be in another folder you can include a path in 
              the filename:
            <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">new File(&quot;c:\myFolder\myFile.txt&quot;);</font></p></td>
      </div>
      <h3>3) Step 3 - Include Error Checking</h3>
      <p>One of the main differences between reading from the keyboard and reading 
        from a file is that when you read from a file you must include error checking 
        or what Java refers to as <strong>Exception Handling</strong>. When reading 
        from a file there is the possiblility that the file being read does not 
        exist, is not located in the designated folder, or has been corrupted 
        and cannot be read. These situations are referred to as exceptions and 
        they must be handled or dealt with in your program or you will get a compiling 
        error. </p>
      <h3>FileNotFoundException</h3>
      <p>When reading from a file the <em>Scanner</em> class throws a <strong>FileNotFoundException</strong> 
        if the file to be read from does not exist. Your program must handle this 
        exception in one of two ways. The first method is to place the Scanner 
        code within a <strong>try/catch</strong> block. The try-catch block is used to trap run-time errors so
		that you can deal with them instead allowing the program to terminate. The second method (the one we will be using) 
        is to place the following code on the line that includes your <em>main</em> 
        method declaration:</p>
      <div id="csCode">
        <pre>public static void main(String[] args) <font color="#FF0000">throws IOException</font></pre>
    </div>
      <p>This code tells the compiler that you are not going to deal with the 
        exception yourself, but instead are going to pass it up one level to the 
        method that invoked your method. In the case of the <em>main</em> method, 
        we are passing the exception to the JVM itself so that it can handle an 
        error if it occurs. The JVM is then responsible for handling the error 
        and displaying an error message if the specified file could not be read.</p>
      <h3>4) Step 4 - Use the Scanner methods to Read from the File</h3>
      <p>If you have done the first three steps correctly then your program is 
        now ready to read the information from the designated file. The method 
        used to retrieve the information depends upon how the data is going to 
        be used in your program. If the data being read is needed to perform a 
        calculation or do some type of arithmetic then you will need to read the 
        information as an integer or double; otherwise, the information can simply 
        be read as a string or strings.</p>

      <h1>Integer Input Examples</h1>
      <p><strong>Method 1 - Read individual Input</strong></p>
      <p>This method is used when the file contains a small number of integer 
        values. They are read one at a time just like if you were reading from 
        the keyboard. </p>
      <div id="csCode">
         <pre>int n1 = scan.nextInt();   <font color="#0000FF">// reads 1st integer from file</font>
int n2 = scan.nextInt();   <font color="#0000FF">// reads 2nd integer from file</font>
int n3 = scan.nextInt();   <font color="#0000FF">// reads 3rd integer from file</font>
int n4 = scan.nextInt();   <font color="#0000FF">// reads 4th integer from file</font>
int n5 = scan.nextInt();   <font color="#0000FF">// reads 5th integer from file</font>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Sample File</strong></p>
      <div id=csOutput>10 20 30 40 50</font>
    </div>
      <p><strong>Method 2 &#8211; Read all Input</strong></p>
      <p>This method is used when file contains a large number of integer values 
        or the actually number of values is not known. The <strong>hasNextInt</strong> 
        method returns <em>true</em> as long as there is an integer value in the 
        file that has not been read. The <em>hasNextInt</em> method is combined 
        with a <em>while</em> loop to read the entire file one integer at a time.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
       <pre>int n=0;
while(scan.hasNextInt())   <font color="#0000FF">// reads all the integers from the file</font>
{
   n = scan.nextInt();
}</pre>

      <p><strong>Sample File</strong></p>

        by spaces or end-of-line markers.</p>

      <p><strong>Method 3&#8211; Read all Input Lines</strong></p>
      <p>This method is different from method 2 in that it reads an entire line 
        as one string. It disguises the strings by end-of-line marker only.</p>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>String s;

      <p>The first time through the while loop the entire line &quot;Mary had 
        a little lamb&quot; is read and stored in the String variable s.</p>
