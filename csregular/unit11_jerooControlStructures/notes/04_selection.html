<p>The Jeroo language supports both an if structure and an if-else structure, and supports a way
   to construct a multi-way branching structure. The syntax of each is shown below. An example of
   each follows its syntax.</p>		
  <h1>Jeroo's if Structure</h1>
  <p>The figure below shows the syntax of the if structure in Jeroo's Java style language.</p>
  <p>There are three important things to observe about the syntax.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>The condition must be in parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no semicolon after the parentheses.</li>
		<li>The if structure is not a method, which means that we do not send it as a message
		    to a Jeroo object.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
   <p>There are three important things to observe about the coding style.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>Braces are used to define the beginning and end of the body.</li>
		<li>The braces are aligned with the start of the word while.</li>
		<li>The statements between the braces are indented.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>

  <h3>EXAMPLE (if structure)</h3>
  <p>Have the Jeroo named jessica check for a net to her right. If there is one, have her disable
     it and return to her current state. Whether or not she disables a net, jessica should hop one
     space ahead.</p>
	<br> 
  <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control10.gif"></div>
  
  <h1>Jeroo's if-else Structure</h1>
  <p>The figure below shows the syntax of the if-else structure in Jeroo's Java-style language.</p>
  <p>There are four important things to observe about the syntax.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>The condition must be in parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no semicolon after the parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no semicolon after the keyword else.</li>
		<li>The if-else structure is not a method, which means that we do not send it as a message
		    to a Jeroo object.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
   <p>There are three important things to observe about the coding style.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>Braces are used to define the beginning and end of the body.</li>
		<li>The braces are aligned with the start of the word while.</li>
		<li>The statements between the braces are indented.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control11.gif"></div>
  
  <h3>EXAMPLE (if-else structure)</h3>
  <p>Have the Jeroo named timmy check for a net straight ahead. If there is one, have him disable
     it and turn around. If there is not a net straight ahead, timmy should turn right. After he
	 disables the net and turns around or simply turns right, timmy must move one space forward.</p>
	<br> 
   <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control12.gif"></div>
   
   <h1>Jeroo's Multi-way Selection Structure (a cascaded if)</h1>
   <p>The figure below shows a common technique for writing a multi-way selection structure in
      Jeroo's Java-style language. Technically, this structure consists of a series of nested if
	  statements, but the coding style obscures this fact and makes the multi-way selection logic
	  more evident. This particular structure is often called a cascaded if.</p>
  <p>There are five important things to observe about about this structure.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>Each condition must be in parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no semicolon after the parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no limit on the number of else-if blocks.</li>
		<li>The final else block is optional.</li>
		<li>This structure is not a method, which means that we do not send it as a message to a
		    Jeroo object.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
   <p>There are three important things to observe about the coding style.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>Braces are used to define the beginning and end of the body.</li>
		<li>The braces are aligned with the start of the word while.</li>
		<li>The statements between the braces are indented.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
  <br>
   <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control13.gif"></div>
   
   <h3>EXAMPLE (cascaded if structure)</h3>
   <p>Assume that a Jeroo named louisa is carrying at least one flower. Have her check the cell
     ahead. If that cell contains a flower, pick it. If that cell contains a net, disable it. 
	 If that cell contains water, plant a flower at the current location. If that cell contains
	 another Jeroo, give that Jeroo a flower. Finally, if there is nothing in that cell, have her
	 hop once and turn left.</p>
