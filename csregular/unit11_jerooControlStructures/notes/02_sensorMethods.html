  <h1>Sensor Methods</h1>
  <p>The <strong>sensor methods</strong> are used to ask a Jeroo something about its immediate surroundings. 
     Each sensor method has either a true or a false result. Any method that produces either true
	 or false as a result is called a Boolean method. More generally, any expression that is either
	 true or false is called a <strong>Boolean expression</strong>. This means that the conditions that are used in
	 various control structures are, in fact, Boolean expressions</p>
  <p>In the Jeroo language, the sensor methods are the basic building blocks for creating conditions. 
     The simplest way to create a condition is to invoke a sensor method. Table 6.3 lists all of the
	 sensor methods in the Jeroo language. These methods can only be used to construct conditions.
	 Since they are methods, they are invoked by sending a message to a Jeroo object.</p>
