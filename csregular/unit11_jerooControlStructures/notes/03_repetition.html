  <h1>Jeroo's while Loop</h1>
  <p>A <strong>pretest while loop</strong> is the only repetition structure in the Jeroo language. The figure below
     shows the syntax of the pretest while loop in Jeroo's Java style language.</p>
  <p>There are three important things to observe about the syntax.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>The condition must be in parentheses.</li>
		<li>There is no semicolon after the parentheses.</li>
		<li>The while structure is not a method, which means that we do not send it as a message to a Jeroo object.</li>
	 </ol>
  </div>
   <p>There are three important things to observe about the coding style.</p>
  
  <div id="csList">
     <ol>
	    <li>Braces are used to define the beginning and end of the body.</li>
		<li>The braces are aligned with the start of the word while.</li>
		<li>The statements between the braces are indented.</li>
	 </ol>

  <h3>EXAMPLE (pretest while structure)</h3>
  <p>Assume that a Jeroo named kim is not standing on a flower, but there is a line of flowers
     ahead. Have kim pick all of those flowers, and stop as soon as there is no flower directly
	 ahead. After picking all of the flowers, kim should turn to the left.</p>
