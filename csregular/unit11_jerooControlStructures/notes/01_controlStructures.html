<h1>Generic Control Structures</h1>
<p>The methods that we have written thus far have a common characteristic - sequential execution.
   Sequential execution means that the statements are executed one after another in the order that
   they appear in the source code. In this unit, we will learn how to create a block of statements
   that can be executed several times in succession, how to create an optional block of statements,
   and how to create alternative blocks of statements.</p>
<p>A <strong>control structure</strong> is a feature of a programming language that determines the order in which
   statements will be executed. There are three categories of control structures: (1) sequential
   structure, (2) repetition structures (also called loops), and (3) selection structures.</p>
<p>The sequential structure is the default structure that is used by all programming languages. 
   Unless we indicate otherwise, the statements will be executed in the order that they appear in
   the source code, and each statement will be executed exactly once each time a method is called.
   Every program that we have seen thus far uses nothing but the sequential structure.</p>
<p>A condition is a crucial part of the repetition structures and the selection structures. 
   A <strong>condition</strong> is any expression that can be either true or false.</p>
<p>Every <strong>repetition structure (or loop)</strong> allows a group of statements to be executed several times
   in succession. There are two important selection structures: a loop that is controlled by the
   state of the objects in the program, and a loop that is controlled by a counter. The Jeroo
   language supports just one kind of loop, one that is controlled by the state of the objects in
   the program. The Jeroo language does not support a counter-controlled loop because Jeroos can't
   count.</p>
<p>Every selection structure defines alternate paths through the source code. There are three
   important selection structures: an if structure, an if-else structure, and a multi-way branching
   structure. An <strong>if structure</strong> (sometimes called an if-then structure) defines an optional block of
   statements. An <strong>if-else structure</strong> (sometimes called an if-then-else structure) defines two 
   different blocks of statements, only one of which will be executed. A <strong>multi-way branching
   structure</strong> defines several different blocks of statements, only one of which will be executed.
   Some programming languages have an explicit statement such as switch or case to create a 
   multi-way branching structure. Jeroo's Java style language has both an if structure and an
   if-else structure, and it supports a common technique for building a multi-way branching 
   structure.</p>
<h1>Generic Repetition Structures</h1>
<p>There are two major parts to every repetition structure, the <strong>body</strong> and the <strong>controlling condition</strong>.
   These two parts provide a way to classify loops.</p>
<p>The block of statements that can be executed repeatedly is called the body of the loop. Each time
   that the statements in the body are executed is called a trip (or iteration) through the loop, 
   and the number of times the body is executed is called the trip count.</p>
<p>The controlling condition is a condition that is checked to determine whether to make a trip 
   through the body or terminate the loop. The controlling condition is rechecked after each trip
   through the body of the loop.</p>
<p>One criterion for classifying loops is based on when the controlling condition is checked
   relative to the first trip through the body. In a pretest loop, the controlling condition is
   always checked before the body can be executed for the first time. In a posttest loop, the
   controlling condition is not checked until after the first trip through the body. In either case,
   the condition is checked after each trip through the body to determine whether or not to make 
   another trip.</p>
<p>A second criterion for classifying loops is based on whether a true condition or a false 
   condition leads to a trip through the body. In a while loop, a true condition leads to a trip
   through the body, but a false condition terminates the loop. In an until loop, a true condition
   terminates the loop, but a false condition leads to a trip through the body. The difference
   between the while and until loops is summarized in table below.</p>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control1.gif"></div>
   
<p>Combining these two criteria, we can define four broad categories of loops: pretest while,
   pretest until, posttest while, and posttest until. The table below shows the relationship 
   between these categories and some popular programming languages.</p>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control2.gif"></div>
   
<p>Since the Jeroo language only contains one repetition structure, we will take a closer look at
   the pretest while loop. The figure below shows a generic pretest while loop and uses arrows to
   show the order in which statements are executed and the condition is checked.</p>

<h1>Generic Selection Structures</h1>
<p>An <strong>if structure</strong> (sometimes called an if-then structure) defines an optional block of statements.
   There are two parts to an if structure, the selection condition and the true branch. The true 
   branch contains a block of statements that will only be executed whenever the selection condition
   is true.</p>
<p>The figure below shows a generic if structure, and uses arrows to show the order in which 
   statements will be executed. There are some similarities with the while loop, but there is one
   important difference. The if structure (NOT "if loop") defines optional code, and that code is
   either skipped or executed just once. There is no repetition.</p>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/Jeroo/control4.gif"></div>
   
<p>An <strong>if-else structure</strong> (sometimes called an if-then-else structure) defines two different blocks
   of statements, only one of which will be executed. An if-else structure consists of three parts,
   the selection condition, the true branch, and the false branch. The true branch contains a block
   of statements that will be executed whenever the selection condition is true. The false branch
   contains a block of statements that will be executed whenever the selection condition is false.</p>
