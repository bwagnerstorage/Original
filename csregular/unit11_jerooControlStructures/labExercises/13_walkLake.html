<h1>Recursion</h1>
  <p><strong>Recursion</strong> is a programming technique where a method calls itself. Recursion
     is useful because it allows your program to repeat a process just like the while control
	 structure. Let's look at an example. Suppose I have a Jeroo named bob located on the west
	 shore of an island and I want him to walk across the island until he reaches the east shore.
	 Using recursion I could do the following.</p>

  <p>In the main method create the Jeroo bob and place him on the west shore of the island then
     call the user defined method walk.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/Jeroo/demo1.gif"><br><br>
<p>In the <strong>walk</strong> method have bob hop forward one space then have the method call itself. This call
   to walk method is a recursive call because we are making a call to method that we are currently
   in. When the program reaches the call to walk method it returns execution back to the top of the
   walk method and starts over again.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/Jeroo/demo2.gif"><br><br>
<p>There is, however, one flaw in this program. The Jeroo does not stop when it reaches the east
   shore. When you use recursion it is important to add a condition to make the recursion stop.
   In programming terminology we call this a base case. Look at the modified walk method.</p>
   
<br>
<img src="images/Jeroo/demo3.gif"><br><br>

<p>I have added the condition that the recursion will only continue if the water is not ahead.
   Now the Jeroo will stop when it reaches the east shore.</p>
   
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Monsoon rains have created a lake in the middle of Santong Island. The goal of this program is
   to have the Jeroo explore the shoreline of the lake. The Jeroo starts at location (12,2) facing
   North with one flower in its pouch. The Jeroo starts by planting a flower then travelling,
   keeping the lake on its right, until it returns to the flower. The Jeroo should stop when 
   it reaches the flower.
   <br>Use recursion in your implementation.</p>
