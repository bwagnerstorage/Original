<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A jeroo named Ali went on a hike. After many hours of walking he became lost 
    but he decided it would be best to continue on the path he had found. As he 
    walked along the path he came upon a large mountain. He was reminded of a 
    story his father once told him about a mountain in the center of their island 
    where ancient jeroos had built four tunnels through the mountain as a shortcut 
    to get from one side of the island to the other. However, to ward off their 
    enemies only one of the four tunnels actually made completely through the 
    mountain to the other side. Since Ali did not have anymore flowers in his 
    pouch, he decides his best chance of surviving his journey was to find the 
    right tunnel.</p>
  <p>Write a jeroo program that uses control structure to allow Ali to search 
    for the tunnel that will lead him through the mountain to the other side. 
    To mark the exit to the correct tunnel the ancient jeroos planted a patch 
    of winsum flowers.</p>
  <p>*In this story the nets represent the mountain.</p>
