<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This is a group activity for groups of sizes 1 to 3 people. Your task is to create a Jeroo assignment that
   allows other students to practice a concept that you have learned while using Jeroo. Your assignment could cover 
   somethinng as simple as the basic Jeroo action methods (hop, pick, toss, etc.) or more advanced topics like user-defined methods (turnAround, disableNet, etc.),
   control-structures(while, if, if/else) and sensor methods(isWater, isNet, isJeroo, etc.), logical operators 
   (! - not, && - and, || - or), or recursion.</p>
<h1>Project Requirements</h1> 
<p>Your project should include the following:

<ul  id="csList">
<li>A working model of the assignment with its code and island file. (Your assignment is not required to have an island.</li>
<li>An assignment description that resembles the format I used in creating the assignments on my website. This can be
    written using word, google docs, or html.</li>
<li>The assignment description should also include a listing of the programmming concepts your assignment
    is targeting.</li>
	<li>Screenshots of the island that provide a visual description of what the island should look like at different
	stages of the program.</li>
	<li>At the top of the assignment page include a section that lists all of the students in your group.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Submitting Assignment</h1>
<p>You will turn in your assignment by creating a folder on one of your group members' google drive and then share 
   that folder with me at <strong>bwagner@g.dentonisd.org</strong>. The folder name should use the following format:
   Class Block_Student1 - First Initial LastInitial_Student2 - First Initial Last Initial_Student3 - First Initial Last Initial.
   Example folder names:  1_AM_CR_KB, B3_TN_DW</p>
<br>
<p>I have had my current assignments for many years and I am looking for some new fresh ideas. I am hoping that you
   bright students can come up with assignments that I can add to my website to enhance or replace my aging assignments. </p>
