<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Sam is a Jeroo and he is in love. To demonstrate his love he has decided to cross the island to other side to pick a special kind of
   flower for his sweetheart that only grows along the east shoreline. His journey is difficult because there is a fast moving river
   that runs right through the middle of the island. He has heard rumors that there is a small bridge that crosses the river but he does
   not know where it is. Your task is help Sam find the bridge, cross the river, pick a flower, and then return to his starting location.
   Sam starts his journey at location (0,0).</p>
