<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A jeroo loves flowers so much that he wants to cover the entire island with them. He decides
     the best way to plant the flowers is in a spiral pattern where he starts on the perimeter
	 of the island and continues to move toward the center until the entire island is covered
	 with flowers. Write a program that allows the jeroo to plant flowers in this spiral pattern.
	 The jeroo should stop when the entire island is covered with flowers. The images below show
	 the progression of the spiral pattern at different points in the program.</p>
