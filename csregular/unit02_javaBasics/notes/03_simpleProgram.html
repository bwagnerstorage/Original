  <h1>First Java Program</h1>
  <p>A <strong>programming language</strong> is used to give instructions to a computer. These instructions consist of
     words and symbols that have been assigned special meaning. In the Java programming language
	 there are around 50 reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language. A <strong>program</strong> is
	 a computer file that contains programming instructions, also known as a <strong>source file</strong> or <strong>source code</strong>. 
	 The program below contains some of the keywords and symbols of the Java language. Let's start our programming 
	 journey by looking at some of the key features of this simple program. These features are important because
	 they are fundamental to all Java programs.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
  <h3>Feature 1: All Java programs are contained within one or more classes.</h3>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>public class HelloWorld</pre></div>
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Classes are a very important part of the Java language. You will learn more about classes in future
   lessons. The important point here is that every program you write will have a class. The name of
   the class in this program is <strong>HelloWorld</strong>. A class name can be virtual any thing as long as it begins with a letter
   (not a number or symbol) and it contains no spaces. By convention, Java programmers capitalize the
   first letter of each word within the name. Convention means that it is not a rule that has to be
   followed; instead it is just something that most programmers have adopted to provide some consistence 
   among Java programs. If you were to look at another persons program and saw a word capitalized you
   could assume, because of the convention, that it was the name of a class.</p>
   
  <h3>Feature 2: Curly braces are used to mark the beginning and end of a class.</h3>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class HelloWorld
<font color="#FF0000">{</font>
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
<font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The curly braces will always occur in pairs. The open curly brace marks the beginning of the class and
   the close curly brace marks the end. Curly braces are also used to mark other blocks of code within 
   Java programs.</p>
   
   <h3>Feature 3: Every Java program will contain a main method.</h3>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class HelloWorld
{
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>public static void main(String[] args)</pre></div>
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>The main method is the entry point for the computer into your program. When your program is executed
   the computer will execute the code starting at the main method. The main method contains
   several keywords and symbols. The meaning of these words and symbols will become apparent in future lessons. 
   For now all you need to know is that your programs must have a main method and it needs to look exactly
   like the main method in this program. Notice that the beginning and end of the main method is also
   marked by curly braces.</p>
   
      <h3>Feature 4: The main method will contain one or more Java statements.</h3>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      <div id="csHighlight"><pre>System.out.println("Hello World");</pre></div>
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>A program is a set of instructions. These instructions are called <strong>statements</strong> in Java. 
   Statements can be anything from a single line of code to a complex mathematical equation. This program
   contains one statement that instructs the computer to display the phrase "Hello World" onto the
   terminal window.</p>
   
      <h3>Feature 5: All Java statements must end with a semicolon.</h3>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World")<font color="#FF0000">;</font>
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Semicolons are used to mark the end of Java statements; not spacing, tabbing, indenting, or 
   carriage returns. All of the spacing you see in the program is removed when the program is compiled.
   The spacing is there to make it easier for us humans to read the code. With proper use of
   semicolons the entire program could be written on one line.</p>
<p>Since curly braces are also used to mark the beginning and end of Java statements you
   never put a semicolon before an open curly brace. Notice again in the program that there
   is not a semicolon after the class definition or the main method.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class HelloWorld<font color="#FF0000"><-- no semicolon here</font>
{
   public static void main(String[] args)<font color="#FF0000"><-- no semicolon here</font>
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
</pre></div>
      <h3>Feature 6: Java is case-sensitive.</h3>
<p>All keywords in Java should be declared using lower-case letters. There is a difference
   between public and Public.</p>
