<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Your school's booster club runs a concession stand at sporting events to
     raise money. They currently sale the following items:
  <table id="csTable" style="margin:25px">
     <tr>
	    <th>Item</th>
        <th>Cost</th>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	    <td>Hamburger</td>
        <td align="right">2.00</td>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	    <td>Hotdog</td>
        <td align="right">1.50</td>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	    <td>Chips</td>
        <td align="right">.50</td>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	    <td>Candy</td>
        <td align="right">1.00</td>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	    <td>Drink</td>
        <td align="right">1.00</td>
     </tr>
  </table>
  <p>They have asked you to write a program that will allow them to enter
     the num of items sold for each food type and then generate a receipt
	 showing the cost of each food type along with a grand total of the
	 cost of the food. They want the receipt to only show food items that
	 were purchased.</p>
  <h3>Problem Decomposition</h3>
  <p>Using the structure chart below you decomposed the problem into the following three methods:
   <strong>enterPurchases</strong>, <strong>calculateTotals</strong>, and <strong>printReceipt</strong>.</p>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/concession1.png"></div>
