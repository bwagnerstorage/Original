  <h1>Preconditions and Postconditions</h1>
  <p>We should always define a behavior carefully before we write the code for the corresponding
     method. A complete definition for a behavior must include a statement of the preconditions and
	 the postconditions.</p>
  <p>A <strong>precondition</strong> for a method is something that is assumed to be true before the method is
     invoked. The portion of the code that invokes the method is responsible for ensuring that all
	 preconditions are satisfied before the method is invoked.</p>
  <p>A <strong>postcondition</strong> for a method is something that is true after the method has been executed.
     The code within the method is responsible for ensuring that all postconditions are met.</p>
  <p>The process of determining good preconditions and postconditions can be difficult, but it is
     easier if we remember a few characteristics of objects and methods.</p>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>All work is done by sending messages to objects.</li>
	  <li>Exactly one object executes a method in response to a message.</li>
	  <li>A method can modify the attributes of the object that executes the method, but cannot directly modify the attributes of any other object.</li>
	  <li>One method can send messages to several different objects, and those messages can lead to modifications in their receivers.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>Using the previous list of characteristics as a guide, we can use the following questions as a
     basis for writing preconditions and postconditions. When we are working with the Jeroo language,
	 we only have to consider two classes of objects, Jeroos and Island cells. We need to consider
	 how a method can change the attributes of the Jeroo object that executes the method. The Island
	 cells are less evident because we cannot send them messages, but the Jeroo actions pick and
	 plant can change the contents of a cell. Behind the scenes, the pick and plant methods send
	 appropriate messages to the island cells.</p>

  <p>The preconditions and postconditions can be created rather informally, but the final versions
     should be stated in a comment block at the beginning of the source code for the method.</p>
