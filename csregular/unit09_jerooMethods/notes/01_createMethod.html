  <h1>Creating and Using a Jeroo Method</h1>
  <p>The Jeroo language contains a set of fundamental methods that define the basic behaviors of
     every Jeroo. These include the basic actions and the sensor methods. Some problems are such
	 that it would be convenient if we could extend the basic behaviors of the Jeroos. The Jeroo
	 language allows us to write <strong>programmer-defined</strong> Jeroo methods that extend the behavior of every
	 Jeroo.</p>
  <p>A behavior is an action that an object can take or a task that it can perform in response to a
     request from an external source. A <strong>method</strong> is a collection of statements that are written in
	 some programming language to describe a specific behavior. These definitions imply that the
	 creation of a method is a two-part process. First, we need to define and name the new behavior.
	 Second, we need to write the source code for the method.</p>
 <h3>Defining a Behavior</h3>
  <p>A Jeroo method contains the source code that describes what an arbitrary Jeroo needs to do to
     carry out the corresponding behavior. The form of a Jeroo method is shown in figure below for
	 Jeroo's Java style language. The method_identifier on the first line (the header line) is a name
	 that the programmer chooses for the method. The name should indicate the corresponding behavior.
	 As with the main method, we should indent every line between the opening and closing braces in 
	 every Jeroo method.</p>

  <p>There is one important difference between a Jeroo method and the main method. Since a Jeroo
     method defines a behavior that applies to every Jeroo, we cannot instantiate a Jeroo in a Jeroo
	 method, and we do not specify which Jeroo is to perform the steps.</p>

  <p>It is possible for one Jeroo method to use another, or even itself.</p>

   <h3>Using a Jeroo Method</h3>
   <p>A Jeroo method is used just like any other method. In the main method, we send a message to a
      specific Jeroo object, requesting that it perform the task associated with the method.</p>
