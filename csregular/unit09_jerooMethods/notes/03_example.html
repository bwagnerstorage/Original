  <h1>Example - Clear Nets and Pick</h1>
  <p>The section contains an extended example that demonstrates the algorithm development process,
     and shows a recommended process for developing source code that contains Jeroo methods.</p>
  <p>Features of the Jeroo Language</p>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>Main Method</li>
	  <li>Basic Actions</li>
	  <li>Jeroo Methods (programmer-defined methods)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Problem Statement (Step 1)</h3>
  <p>A Jeroo starts at (1,4) facing North with 5 flowers in its pouch. There are two nets immediately
     South of the Jeroo at locations (2,4) and (3,4). There is a flower directly South of the second
	 net. Write a program that directs the Jeroo to disable the nets and pick the flower. After
	 picking the flower, the Jeroo should return to its starting location and face South.</p>

  <h3>Analysis of the Problem (Step 2)</h3>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>The Jeroo must turn around to locate the first net.</li>
	  <li>Each net is directly South of the previous one.</li>
	  <li>The first net is directly South of the Jeroo.</li>
	  <li>The flower is at location (4,4).</li>
	  <li>The Jeroo must finish facing South at location (1,4).</li>
	  <li>The Jeroo should finish with 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 flowers.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Detailed Algorithm (Steps 3 and 4)</h3>
  <div id="csOutput">
     
    <pre>
Let's name the Jeroo kim.
kim should do the following
     Turn around         <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (1,4) facing South</font>
     Disable two nets in a row
          Toss
          Hop once       <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (2,4) facing South</font>
          Toss
          Hop once       <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (3,4) facing South</font>
     Get the flower
          Hop once       <font color="#FF00FF">// now on flower at (4,4) facing South</font>
          Pick
     Go back to (1,4) and turn around
          Turn around    <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (4,4) facing North</font>
          Hop 3 times    <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (1,4) facing North</font>
          Turn around    <font color="#FF00FF">// now at (1,4) facing South</font></pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Review the Algorithm (Step 5)</h3>
   <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>The high-level algorithm helps manage the details.</li>
	  <li>We used a "turn around" step previously. We can use the same logic here.</li>
	  <li>The act of turning around appears as a step in the high-level algorithm and as part of the "Go back to (1,4) and turn around" step. Interesting!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Possible Behaviors</h3>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>"Turn around" is used three times </li>
	  <li>The sequence "Toss, Hop" is used two times in the Disable nets step.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>We will write a Jeroo method for each of these behaviors, but first, we need to define a
     purpose, preconditions, and postconditions for each method. This can be done informally,
	 because we will write these things in a comment block at the beginning of each method.</p>
	 
<img src="images/Jeroo/method7.gif">

  <p>The last postcondition of the tossAndHop method simply says that the Jeroo is facing the
     direction it was facing at the start of the method. It does not prohibit the Jeroo from 
	 changing direction during the course of the method as long as the Jeroo returns to its
	 original direction at the end.</p>

<h1>Jeroo Code for "Clear Nets and Pick"</h1>
<p>As before, we should develop the code as a series of builds.</p>
<h3>FIRST BUILD</h3>
<p>The recommended first build contains three things.</p>
  <div id="csList">
    <ol>
      <li>The main method.</li>
	  <li>Declaration and instantiation of every Jeroo that will be used.</li>
	  <li>The high-level algorithm in the form of comments.</li>
	  <li>Skeletons for each of the Jeroo methods. These skeletons are often called stubs.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <img src="images/Jeroo/method8.gif">
  <img src="images/Jeroo/method9.gif">
  
  <h3>BUILD 2</h3>
  <p>This build finishes the turnAround method and uses it in the main method. The new code is shown
     in boldface type. It would be wise to test this method four times, each time start with kim
	 facing in a different direction. Once we are comfortable that this method works correctly,
	 we can proceed with the next build.</p>

	 <img src="images/Jeroo/method11.gif">
	 
   <h3>BUILD 3</h3>
   <p>This build finishes the tossAndHop method and uses it in the main method. Our focus is on
      destroying the two nets. The new code is shown in boldface type.</p>
	  
	<img src="images/Jeroo/method12.gif">
	<img src="images/Jeroo/method13.gif">
	
	<h3>BUILD 4 (final)</h3>
	
	<p>This build finishes the program. The new code is shown in boldface type. We need to check
	   to see that kim has the correct number of flowers at the end.</p>
