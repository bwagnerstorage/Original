<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Create 4 Jeroos, one in each corner of RelayRaceIsland as pictured below. Each Jeroo starts out
     holding a single flower. The first Jeroo is standing on top of a flower which it picks immediately
	 and then races forward to the next Jeroo (disabling the net along the way, of course) and passes
	 the flower on. The second Jeroo passes the flower to the third, and the third to the fourth. 
	 There should be one <strong>well-constructed method</strong> that all 4 Jeroos can use to complete the race. </p>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> To pass a flower from one Jeroo to the next use the give method in one of the following forms.</p>
<p>give(AHEAD);<br>
give(RIGHT);<br>
give(LEFT);</p>
