<h1>Jeroo Simulator</h1>
<p>According to the story on jeroo.org, the Jeroo programming environment was developed as a
   <strong>simulator</strong>, so that scientists could, in the safety and comfort of their lab, study the peculiar behaviors of
   these mysterious creatures. The scientist knew that Jeroos were similiar in nature to kangaroos, 
   but they also knew they possessed their own unique set of behaviors. For example, the fact that Jeroos only
   turn right or left in 90 degree increments. The scientist hoped the simulator might help shine 
   some light on why these fascinating animals behave the way they do.
  </p>
  <p>In the Jeroo simulator, we learned that in order to add a Jeroo to an island environment we had to use code 
     like the following:</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:400px"><pre>Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();</pre></div>
<p>In programming terminology, Jeroo is referred to as a <strong>class</strong>. Classes are the backbone of 
   Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) languages, because they are responsible for defining the attributes and behaviors for
   the objects they create. Referring again to the line of code above, bob is a special type of variable called an <strong>object
   variable</strong> or more simply just an <strong>object</strong> . This object, referred to as bob, is "born" into this programmming world with all 
   the atttributes and behaviors described by its designer, the Jeroo class.</p>
   <p>What attributes and behaviors did the Jeroo class give to bob? The attributes include 
      the ability, like all Jeroos, to store flowers in his pouch, as well as the ability to know which direction
      he is facing and where he is located on the island. The behaviors include the abilty to hop and turn, as well the ability to 
      pick, plant, give, and toss flowers. There are others we will explore in a later unit.</p>

  <h1>Jeroo Methods</h1>
  <p>In Java, the behaviors defined by a class are called <strong>methods</strong>. A method can be defined as a name
     given to a block of code that can be executed by calling the method by its name.
     Look at the following code,</p>
     <div id="csCode" style="width:400px"><pre>
Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();
bob.hop();
</pre></div>
     <p>In this example, the Jeroo class's hop method is being invoked (called) by the object bob.</p>
.    <p>One of the cool features in the Jeroo simulator is that it allows programmers to make their own Jeroo methods. 
        Follow the directions below to see how.</p>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Click on this <a href="https:\\jeroo.org" target="_blank" style="color:blue">link</a> to open the Jeroo environment in your browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the button <strong>START CODING</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the following starter code to the Main Method editor.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>method main()
{
  Jeroo bob = new Jeroo(5,5,EAST,50);
       

}</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>To add your own method to Jeroo class you first have to switch to the Jeroo Methods pane. 
       To do this click the mouse on the Jeroo Methods tab. </p>
       <img src="images/Jeroo/JerooMethods1.jpg" style="width:40%">  
      
</li>
<li><p>With the Jeroo Methods pane visible. Let's make a method. One of things that I don't 
       like about digital Jeroos is they don't know how to turn around, so let's fix that by making a method 
       that tells the Jeroos how to turn around.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 1:</strong> Type: <span style="font-family: Consolas;">method turnAround()</span>  and then open and close curly brackets.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 2:</strong> Inside the curly brackets type: <span style="font-family: Consolas;">turn(RIGHT);</span></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the previous code and paste in the method so that there are <strong>two</strong> turn rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Notice:</strong> We did not use a Jeroo object to call the turn methods. This is because we are writing code that is actually
       being added to the Jeroo class. This new method will be available to all Jeroo objects, not just bob.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that we have made our own method. Let's see if bob has really learned how to turn around. Click on the
       <strong>Method Main</strong> tab to go back to the main method and add the following code: <span style="font-family: Consolas;">bob.turnAround();</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you know how a Jeroo method is made try making one of your own.</p></li>
