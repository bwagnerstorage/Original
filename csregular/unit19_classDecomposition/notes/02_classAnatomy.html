  <p>Now that we have seen the importance of classes in program design the next step is to learn how to make a program that
     uses multiple classes to solve a problem. Before we can do that, however, we must first look at the anatomy of a class.</p>		
  <h1>Anatomy of a Class</h1>
   <p>A class describes two characteristics of an object. First it describes what data an object stores, known as an
	  object's <strong>attributes</strong>. In Java, these attributes are defined through one or more instance variables. Secondly, it
	  describes what an object does, known as an object's <strong>behavior</strong>.
      In Java, this behavior is defined through one or more methods.  The process of combining data
	  and behavior into a single class is called <strong>encapsulation</strong>.</p>
	  
	  <div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition5.png"> </div> 
	  
	  <div id="csNote"><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is
	  one of fundamental principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).</div>
	  
<h1>Example - Rolling the Dice</h1>
<p>Suppose you wanted to write a program that simulated the rolling of dice. This can best be
   accomplished by decomposing the problem into two classes. The first class named Die will 
   define the behavior for an object that represents a single six-sided die. The second class named
   RollDice will define the behavior for an object that simulates the rolling of two dice.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition4.jpg"> </div>

<h3>Die class</h3>
   
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Die
{
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// instance variables</pre></div>
    private int faceValue;
    
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// methods</pre></div>
    public void roll()
    {
        faceValue = (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    }
    
    public int getFaceValue()
    {
        return faceValue;
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>The job of the Die class is simulate a single die. The class contains one instance variable named <strong>faceValue</strong> and two methods named <strong>roll</strong> and <strong>getFaceValue</strong>. The instance variable stores the current value of
   the die (1 - 6). The methods define two behaviors that a die object can perform. A die can roll and a die can show you the value of the roll.</p>
<p>Notice that the Die class does not contain a main method. This is the first time we have written a class that does
   not include a main method. Since it does not contain a main method it cannot be executed by the computer as a stand-alone class, instead it must be used from within another class. In
   this program the Die class will used by the RollDice class.</p>

<h3>RollDice class</h3> 
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class RollDice
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        <div id="csHighlight"><pre>Die die1 = new Die();
        Die die2 = new Die();</pre></div>
        
        for(int i=1; i <= 10; i++)
        {
            die1.roll();
            die2.roll();
            
            System.out.print(die1.getFaceValue() + " ");
            System.out.println(die2.getFaceValue());           
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>The job of the RollDice class is simulate the rolling of two dice. The code for this class is fairly simple so all the code
   for this class is contained within one method - the main method. Since this class contains a main method it will be where the computer starts executing the program.
   In a multi-class program the class that contains the main method is often referred to as the <strong>driver class</strong>.</p>
<p>The RollDice class is the manager for the program. In our hypothetical school the principal is the manager class. One of the most
   important jobs of the principal is to divide the many jobs in the school among the other people(classes). In the same way,
   the RollDice class is responsible for managing this program. One of its main jobs is to divide the work among the other classes
   within the program, namely the Die class.</p>
<h1>Communication Between Classes</h1>
<p>In multi-class programs each class has a specific job to do in helping solve the problem. It is
   often necessary for these classes to communicate with each other. This communication occurs
   using a two step process. First one of the classes must initiate the communication by creating an object
   of another class and storing its reference in an object variable. In our dice program the RollDice
   class needs to communicate with the Die class, so it initiates the communication by creating two
   Die objects.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
Die die1 = new Die();    // first Die object
Die die2 = new Die();    // second Die object 
</pre>
</div>
<p>The second step is to use dot notation so that the initiating class can send messages to the 
   other class. These messages are simply the public methods defined within the class. In our dice program the RollDice class uses dot notation to send messages to the
   Die objects. First it sends a message asking each Die object to perform a roll. </p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
die1.roll();
die2.roll();
</pre>
</div>
It then sends two more messages asking each Die object to let it see the face value of its roll.
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
System.out.print(die1.getFaceValue() + " ");
System.out.println(die2.getFaceValue()); 
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Association</h3>
<p>In OOP terminology this relationship between two classes, where one class uses another, is called 
<strong>Association</strong>.</p>
<h3>Aggregation</h3>
<p>The term <strong>Aggregation</strong> is used to describe a special type of an association. Aggregation is the relationship 
between two classes where an object of one class <strong>has</strong> an object of another. Unlike association, aggregation
always implies a direction. In our dice program a RollDice object <strong>has a</strong> Die object. It is not true, however, that a Die object has a RollDice 
object.</p> 

<div id="csNote">
<strong>Aggregation</strong> is a "has a" relationship. The school has a principal. The team has a coach.
The dog has a tail.</div>

<p>This relationship is demonstrated with the following illustration.</p>
