  <h1>Class Decomposition</h1>
  <p>As programming problems become more complex programmers look for better ways to solve the problems.
     Earlier we learned that <strong>problem decomposition</strong> is a problem solving strategy used by programmers to decrease the complexity
	 of a programming problem by breaking the problem down into smaller subtasks. In many of the programs you wrote you
	 utilized a technique called <strong>method decomposition,</strong> where you divided the problems into multiple methods and each method had a
	 specific task to do in helping solve the problem.</p>
	 
  <p>There is another level of problem decomposition called class decomposition. <strong>Class decomposition</strong> is the process of breaking a programming
     problem into multiple classes where each class has a specific task to perform in solving the problem. In this unit we look at how to decompose
	 a problem using class decomposition.</p>
  
 <h1>Real World Example</h1>
 <p>To help us better understand class decomposition let's look at a real world problem, that is, the problem of running a high school. Running a
    high school is a major undertaking. The first thing to be done in running a school is for the school board to hire a principal. The principal
	is the school's manager, he or she is responsible for everything that goes on in the school. The principal, however, cannot run the school
    alone, the job is just to big. So the principal hires people to help him. He hires assistant principals, counselors, teachers, librarians, 
	coaches, secretaries, custodians, lunch workers, nurses, and the list goes on. Each person has a specific job to do in making the school run
	efficiently.</p>
 <p>The structure chart for a high school might look like the following.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition1.png"> </div>
  
  <h3>Class Decomposition</h3>
  <p>Hypothetically, if we were to write a computer program that solved the problem of running a high school each worker in the school would be a <strong>class</strong>. There
     would be a principal class, an assistant principal class, a counselor class, a teacher class, and so on. This is the process of <strong>class decomposition</strong>. 
	 Just as each worker in the school has a specific job to do, each class within the program has its own job to do in helping solve the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Now let's look more closely at one of the classes of our hypothetical school, namely the teacher class. What is the overall job of a teacher? It is to manage a classroom full of students.
  This is a complex job that entails many tasks. To manage a classroom a teacher has to perform tasks like make lesson plans, make the lessons, present the lessons, make tests, grade papers, take attendance,
     deal with discipline problems, do tutorials, write recommendation letters, and so on. The teacher class in our school program can be divided even further using <strong>method decomposition</strong>, where each job of the teacher is translated into one or more methods.</p>
	 
 <p>Here is a structure chart for the teacher class.</p>
 <div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition2.png"> </div>
 
 <p>In summary, large complex problems can be subdivided into more manageable tasks through the process of <strong>class decomposition</strong>, where each class in the program is responsible for solving one part of the problem.
    Each class can then be further suddivided into even smaller, more specific tasks, through the process of <strong>method decomposition</strong>, where each method within a class is responsible for performing one of the tasks
    assigned to the class.</p>
	
 <H1>Class vs Object</H1>
 <p>Beginning programmers are often confused by the terms <strong>class</strong> and <strong>object</strong>. One of the reasons for this confusion is because people tend to use the two terms interchangeably.
    There is, however a difference. To help explain the difference let's look again at our hypothetical school. Our school was made up of many classes. One of those classes was the teacher
	class. The teacher <strong>class</strong> describes the role of a teacher, it is in essence a job description. The teacher class does not teach. For teaching you need an actual person. Mr. Mueller who teaches
	math, or Mrs. Ware who teaches science, or Mr. Place who teaches Spanish. They are the ones who do the teaching. Using computer terminology, these teachers would be <strong>objects</strong>. It is the
	objects in a program that do the actual work, not the classes. A class is simply a job description, describing what an object does.</p>
	
	<p>Look at the demonstration below that illustrates the difference between a class and an object.</p>

  <p>An <strong>object</strong> is defined by a class. A <strong>class </strong>is a description, model, or blueprint from which an object is created. Consider a blueprint
     created by an architect when designing a house. The blueprint defines the important characteristics of the house - its walls, windows,
	 doors, electrical outlets, and so on. Once the blueprint is created, several houses can be built using it.
	 
	 <div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition3.gif" width="400px"> </div>

  <p>The houses built from the blueprint are different. They are in different locations, they have different addresses, contain different furniture, and different people live in them.
     Yet in many ways they are the "same" house. The layout of the rooms, number of windows and doors, and so on are the same in each. To create a different house, we would need a different blueprint.
  <p>A class is a blueprint of an object. However, a class is not an object any more than a blueprint is a house.</p>
