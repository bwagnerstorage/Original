  <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
  <p>In the last lesson we learned that encapsulation is the process of combining variables and
     methods in a single package called a class. Another aspect of encapsulation is the principle of <strong>information
	 hiding</strong>. With information hiding objects hide their
	 data (instance variables) from other classes by allowing access to the data only through the methods defined
	 within the class. Encapsulation therefore guarantees the integrity of the data contained in the object by
	 controlling how the data is accessed and modified.</p>
  <h3>Television Example</h3>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/tv1.jpg" width="40%"></div>
  <p>To help illustrate this point let's look at a real world example - a television. How do you interact with 
     a TV? You either use a remote or the buttons provided on the front of the console. The manufacturer
	 has provided you with an interface(remote and buttons) to make using the TV easier. Any interaction
	 with the TV occurs through this interface.
  <p>Do you need to know how a TV works inorder to use it? No, all you need to know is how to turn it on, change the 
	 channel, or increase or decrease the volume. In fact, the manufacturer has hidden the details of
	 how the TV works from you by enclosing it in a case. It would not be advisable for you to remove
	 the case and mess with the TV's internal circuitry. </p>
   <p>Just like a TV manufacturer, a programmer, when designing a class, provides an interface. The
      interface consists of the public methods defined within the class. Interaction with the
	  class can only take place through these provided methods. The instance variables are the
	  internal circuitry of the class. Just as it is not wise to mess with a TV's internal circuitry, 
	  it is not advisable for programmers to have direct access to the data within a class. This packaging or encapsulating
	  the data and methods of an object together provides protection from external tampering by users. Many 
	  possible errors can be avoided by adhering to this programming principle.</p>
  <h3>Benefits of Encapsulation</h3>
  <div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li>It simplifies the interaction between objects.</li>
	<li>Allows a class to hide the internal details of how an object does something. </li>
	<li>A class can change its internal implementation without hurting the overall functionality of the system.</li>	
	<li>Prevents code (data) from accidental corruption due to programming errors. </li>
</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Visibility Modifiers</h1>
<p>In Java, we create object encapsulation using visibility modifiers. They control whether other classes
can "see" what's "inside" an object. The reserved words <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> are
visibility modifiers that can be applied to the variables and methods of a class. If a member of a
class has public visibility, it can be "seen" (read and perhaps changed) from outside the object. 
If a member of a class has private visibility, it can be used anywhere inside but not outside the
class definition. Below I have highlighted the visibility modifiers used in the Die class.</p>

<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Die
{
    // variable declarations (instance variables)
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>private</pre></div> int faceValue;
    
    // method declarations
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>public</pre></div> void roll()
    {
        faceValue = (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    }
    
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>public</pre></div> int getFaceValue()
    {
        return faceValue;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Public variables let code outside the class reach in and read or change the value of the data.
   This violates the encapsulation principle. Therefore instance data should be defined with <strong>private</strong> visibility.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>private</pre></div> int faceValue;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Data that is declared as private can be read or changed only by the methods of the class,
   which makes the objects created from that class self-governing. Whether a method has public
   or private visibility depends on the purpose of that method. Methods that provide services to
   other classes must have public visibility.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>public</pre></div> void roll()
{
   faceValue = (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
}
    
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>public</pre></div> int getFaceValue()
{
   return faceValue;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>These methods are sometimes called<strong> service</strong> methods. A private method cannot be
   invoked from outside the class. The only purpose of a private method is to help the other methods
   of the class do their job. Therefore they are sometimes called <strong>support</strong> methods.
</p>

<h3>Constants</h3>
<p>
Giving constants public visibility is generally considered acceptable because, although their values can be accessed directly, they cannot be changed. 
That is because constants are declared using the final modifier.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>final</pre></div> double TAXRATE = 0.825;
</pre>
</div>
 


</p>
