  <h1>Method Types</h1>
  <p>Recall that a <strong>method</strong> is simply a block of code that is given a name. In
     Java, there are two types of methods that you can write. These methods are identified by
	 the type of task they perform.</p>
  <p>What do the following tasks have in common?</p>
  <div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li>Buying a hamburger</li>
	<li>Baking a cake</li>
	<li>Adding two numbers together</li>
	<li>Writing a paper</li>
	<li>Taking a picture</li>
	<li>Withdrawing money from bank</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>One answer is they are all tasks, that when completed, give you something back. They have
     an answer, a product, or a result. When you buy a hamburger the restaurant gives you a
	 hamburger, when you bake a cake the result is a nice slice of heaven (I love cake), when 
	 you add two numbers together you get a sum, when you withdraw money from the bank you get
	 cash in hand, and so forth.</p>
   <p>In Java, methods that give you something back are called <strong>non-void methods</strong>.</p>
   
  <p>All of the Jeroo sensor methods where non-void methods. Their answers were 
    either true or false.</p>
      <div id="csOutput">
    <pre>
<font color="#0000FF">Jeroo Sensor Methods
----------------------------</font>
isClear()
isFacing()
isFlower()
isJeroo()
isNet()
isWater()
hasFlower()
</pre>
</div>
    <p>What do the these tasks have in common?</p>
  <div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaning your room</li>
	<li>Making your bed</li>
	<li>Turning off a light</li>
	<li>Mowing the lawn</li>
	<li>Taking a letter to the mailbox</li>
	<li>Filling car with gas</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>One answer is they are all tasks, that when completed, do not give you anything back. Now there
     might be a result but the result is not really something you get back. When you clean your room
	 the result is a clean room but that is not something you can take with you. When the task is 
	 done it is just done.</p>
  <p>In Java, methods that do not give you something back are called <strong>void methods</strong>.</p>
  
     <p>All of the Jeroo Action methods where void methods. They just performed a task.
<div id="csOutput">  <pre>
<font color="#0000FF">Jeroo Action Methods
----------------------------</font>
hop()
give()
pick()
plant()
toss()
turn()
</pre>
</div>
  <p>In this lesson, we examine these two types of methods. We will start our discussion with
     the void method which you are already familiar.</p>
  
  <h1>void Methods</h1>
  <p>Look at the definition of the void method printName. Assume two String variables, lastName and
     firstName, have been defined as instance variables.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>void</pre></div> printName()
{
   System.out.println("Lastname = " + lastName);
   System.out.println("Firstname = " + firstName);
}</pre>
  </div>
  <p>The <strong>return type</strong> for this method is highlighted in red. The method's return type is declared
     void therefore it is a <strong>void</strong> method.  This method performs a task but it does
	 not give anything back. It is said to be void of a return value.</p>
  <h3>Calling void Methods</h3>
  <p>To execute or call a void method you write the method name along with open and close
     parentheses. The following example shows the void method being called from
	 the main method.</p>	 
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public static void main(String[] args)
{
   MyClass app = new MyClass();
   app.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>printName</pre></div>();
}</pre>  </div>
  <p>Notice that a void method is called as a single statement on a line by itself.</p>
<h3>Methods Called by Other Methods</h3>
<p>Methods can be called by other methods. Look at the following example.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public void printName()
{
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>printLastName</pre></div>();
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>printFirstName</pre></div>();
}

public void printLastName()
{
   System.out.println("Lastname = " + lastName);
}

public void printFirstName()
{
   System.out.println("Firstname = " + firstName);
}</pre>
  </div>
<p>When method printName is executed it makes a call to method printLastName. When method
   printLastName completes execution then control is returned to printName where it then makes a call
   to method printFirstName.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that when a method is called from within the main method dot notation is used.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public static void main(String[] args)
{
   MyClass app = new MyClass();
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>app.</pre></div>printName();
}</pre></div>
<p>However, when a method is called by another method, that is not the main method, dot notation is not
used.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public void printName()
{
    printLastName();
    printFirstName();
}
</pre></div>
<p>The reason for this difference has to do with the fact that the main method is declared <strong>static</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>static</pre></div> void main(String[] args)
</pre>
  </div>
<p>Static methods are covered in another unit. For now just know that if you call a method
   from within the main method you must use dot notation. If the call is not made from within the main
   method you do not.</p>
<p>Incidentally there is another situation that requires the use of dot notation and that is when you make a call to a method that belongs to another
   class. For example, in your class if you make a call to a Scanner method you would use code like the following.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int num = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>keyboard</pre></div>.nextInt();
</pre></div>
<h1>Non-void Methods</h1>
<p>All of the Java standard library methods you have used in
   your programs so far were actually <strong>non-void</strong> methods. Here is a list of some of them.</p>
<div id="csOutput">  <pre>
<font color="#0000FF">Java - Math Class
----------------------------</font>
sqrt()
min()
max()
round()

<font color="#0000FF">Java - Scanner Class
----------------------------</font>
nextInt()
nextDouble()
nextLine()
next()

<font color="#0000FF">Java - String Class
----------------------------</font>
equals()
length()
substring()

<font color="#0000FF">Java - Integer Class
----------------------------</font>
parseInt()
</pre>
  </div>
<p>Non-void methods differ from void methods in that they give something back. What they "give back" 
   is dependent upon their return type. Let's look at an example. Assume that the variables, num1 
   and num2, have been declared as instance variables of type int.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>int</pre></div> sum()
{
   return num1 + num2;
}
</pre>
  </div>
<p>The return type for method sum is highlighted in red. The return type declares what the method
   is going to "give back" or return. The keyword <strong>return</strong> is required in all non-void 
   methods. Since the method sum has a return type of int the return line is required to return a
   value of this type.</p>
   
   
<p>A non-void method's return line can be just about anything as long the code after the return
   matches the return type. Here are some examples.</p>
   <p>A method can return a <strong>literal value</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return 500;
return 98.6;
return "John Wayne";
return true;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>A method can return the contents of a <strong>variable</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return average;
return name;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>A method can return the result of a <strong>mathematical expression</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return 15 * 7 + 20;
return (num1 + num2) / 2;</pre>
  </div> 
  <p>A method can return the result of a <strong>boolean expression</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return num > num2;
return num != 0 && num < 1000;
return lastName.equals(name);</pre>
  </div> 
   
<h3>Calling non-void Methods</h3>

<p>The way that a non-void method is called differs from the way that a void method
   is called in that the call is made from within other Java statements. Since a non-void
   method always returns a value, this value has to be stored in a variable, printed, or 
   returned to a Java control structure or another method. Here are some examples.</p>
   
 <p>The method call can be in an <strong>assignment statement</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int num = sum();
double avg = calculateAverage();
String name = getName();</pre>
  </div>
<p>The method call can be in a <strong>print</strong> or <strong>println statement</strong>.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum());
System.out.println("Avg = " + calculateAverage());
System.out.println(getName() + " is my name");</pre>
  </div>
 <p>The method call can be inside a Java structure such as an <strong>if statement</strong> or <strong>looping
    structure</strong> (you will learn about loops in the next unit).</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
if(sum() > 500)
if(calculateAverage() == 100)
if(getName().equals("John Wayne"))
while(!getName().equals("stop")</pre>
  </div>
  
 <p>The method call can be on the return line of another method.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return sum() / numItems;
return calculateAverage() > 70;</pre>
  </div>
 
<p>The demonstration below shows the order of execution for a non-void method.</p>  
   
  <div class = "slider" id="slider1">
       <ul class="bjqs">
          <li><img src="images/NonVoid1/Slide1.PNG"></li>

  <h1>Boolean Non-Void Methods</h1>
  <p>A common type of non-void method is a method that has a return type of <strong>boolean</strong>.
     Recall that a boolean value can only be either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csNote">
<strong>Programming Note</strong>: all of the Jeroo sensor methods have a return type of boolean.
  </div>
   <p>Let's look at an example. Assume that the variables, num1 and num2, have been declared as
      instance variables of type int.</p>
   
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public boolean isBigger()
{
   if(num1 > num2)
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
</pre>
  </div>
<p>Method isBigger returns a value of <strong>true</strong> if num1 is greater than num2; otherwise it returns
   a value of <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p>This method could also have been written like the following.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public boolean isBigger()
{
    return (num1 > num2);
}
</pre>
  </div>
<p>The boolean expression (num1 &gt; num2) evaluates to either true or false which is then returned
   by the method.</p>
     <div id="csNote">
<strong>Programming Note</strong>: methods that return a boolean value often have the word "is"
   placed in front of the method name. (Ex. isWater, isJeroo, isBigger)
  </div>
 <h3>Calling Boolean Non-Void Methods</h3>
 <p>Boolean non-void methods are called in the same way as other non-void methods. Their return value needs
    to be stored in a variable, printed, or returned to a Java control structure or another method.</p>
 <p>Here are two examples.</p>
    <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
boolean result = isBigger();   <div id="csComment"><pre>// return value stored in boolean variable</pre></div>

if(isBigger())                 <div id="csComment"><pre>// returned within an if statement</pre></div>
{
    <div id="csComment"><pre>// do something</pre></div>
}

</pre>
  </div>
<h1>Non-Void Methods with Multiple Return Lines</h1>
<p>A non-void method can have more than one return line. Look at the example.</p>

 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public String getSeason(int month)
{
   if(month == 1 || month == 2 || month == 12)
      return "winter";
   if(month == 3 || month == 4 || month == 5)
      return "spring";
   if(month == 6 || month == 7 || month == 8)
      return "summer";

   return "fall";</pre>
  </div>
<p>Given a month of the year, method getSeason returns one of four string values. Once a return
   line is executed the method is complete and control is returned back to where the method was
   called. All code below the return line that was executed is ignored. The use of multiple
   return statements makes the use of if-else statements unnecessary.</p>
<p>Notice that the "fall" return line is not in an if statement.</p>
 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
return "fall";</pre>
  </div>
<p>This is required. When you place return statements inside if statements you must have at
   least one return that is not in an if statement; otherwise you will get a "<strong>missing return statement</strong>"
   compiling error.</p>
<br>
</div>
