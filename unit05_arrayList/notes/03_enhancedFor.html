<h1>Enhanced for Loop</h1>
<p>
Java version 5.0 introduced a very convenient shortcut for iterating through a sequence of elements
 - such as the elements of an array or ArrayList. It is called the <strong>enhanced for loop</strong>.</p>

<h1>Using the Enhanced for Loop with an Array</h1>
<p>Suppose you want to total up all data values in an array named data. Here is a typically for
   loop operation that can perform this task (Assume the array data has been defined and populated
   with numbers).</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
double sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < data.length; i++)
{
   double e = data[i];
   sum += e;
}
</pre></div>
<p> Now here is how you use the enhanced for loop to carry out the same task.</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>
double sum = 0;
for(double e : data)
{
   sum += e;
}
</pre></div>

<p>The loop body is executed for each element in the array data. At the beginning of each loop
   iteration, the next element is assigned to the variable e. Then the loop body is executed. 
   You can read this loop as "for each e in data".</p>

<p>Note an important difference between the "for each" loop and the ordinary for loop. 
   In the "for each" loop, the element variable e is assigned values data[0], data[1], and so on.
   In the ordinary for loop, the index variable i is assigned values 0, 1, and so on.</p>

<h1>Using the Enhanced for Loop with an ArrayList</h1>
<p>You can also use the enhanced for loop to visit all elements of an ArrayList. 
  For example, the following loop computes the total value of all accounts. (Assume an ArrayList
  named accounts has been defined and populated with BankAccount objects.)</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
double sum = 0;
for(BankAccount a : accounts)
{
   sum += a.getBalance();
}
 </pre></div>

This loop is equivalent to the following ordinary for loop:
<div id="csCode"><pre>
double sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < accounts.size(); i++)
{
   BankAccount a = accounts.get(i);
   sum += a.getBalance();
}
</pre></div>
<p>The "for each" loop, as its also called, has a very specific purpose: traversing the elements
   of a collection, from the beginning to the end. Sometimes you don't want to start at the beginning,
   or may need to traverse the collection backwards. In those situations, do not hesitate to use an
   ordinary for loop.</p>
