<h1>Modifying a picture</h1>
<p>Even though digital pictures have millions of pixels, modern computers are so fast that they can process
all of them quickly. You will write methods in the Picture class that modify digital pictures. The
Picture class inherits from the SimplePicture class and the SimplePicture class
implements the DigitalPicture interface as shown in the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
class diagram in Figure 5.</p>
<p>A <strong>UML class diagram</strong> shows classes and the relationships between the classes. Each class is shown in a
box with the class name at the top. The middle area shows attributes (instance or class variables) and the
bottom area shows methods. The open triangle points to the class that the connected class inherits from.
The straight line links show associations between classes. <strong>Association</strong> is also called a <strong>"has-a"</strong> relationship.
The numbers at the end of the association links give the number of objects associated with an object at
the other end. For example, in Figure 5 it shows that one Pixel object has one Color object
associated with it and that a Color object can have zero to many Pixel objects associated with it.
You may notice that the UML class diagram doesn't look exactly like Java code. UML isn't language
specific.</p>

<p>DigitalPicture is an <strong>interface</strong>. An interface most often only has public abstract methods. An
abstract method is not allowed to have a body. Notice that none of the methods declared in
DigitalPicture have a body. If a method can't have a body, what good is it?</p>
<p>Interfaces are useful for separating what from how. An interface specifies what an object of that type
needs to be able to do but not how it does it. You cannot create an object using an interface type. A class
can implement (realize) an interface as SimplePicture does. A non-abstract class provides bodies
for all the methods declared in the interface, either directly or through inheritance. You can declare a
variable to be of an interface type and then set that variable to refer to an object of any class that
implements that interface. For example, Java has a List interface that declares the methods that a list
should have such as add, remove, and get, etc. But, if you want to create a List object you
will create an ArrayList object. It is recommended that you declare a variable to be of type List,
not ArrayList, as shown below (for a list of names).</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
List&lt;String&gt; nameList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</pre></div>

<p>Why wouldn't you just declare nameList to be of the type ArrayList&lt;String&gt;? There are
other classes in Java that implement the List interface. By declaring nameList to be of the type
List&lt;String&gt; instead of ArrayList&lt;String&gt;, it is easy to change your mind in the future
and use another class that implements the same interface. Interfaces give you some flexibility and reduce
the number of changes you might need to make in the future, as long as your code only uses the
functionality defined by the interface.</p>

<p>Because DigitalPicture declares a getPixels2D method that returns a two-dimensional
array of Pixel objects, SimplePicture implements that interface, and Picture inherits
from SimplePicture, you can use the getPixels2D method on a Picture object. You can
loop through all the Pixel objects in the two-dimensional array to modify the picture. You can get
and set the red, green, and/or blue value for a Pixel object. You can also get and/or set the Color
value for a Pixel object. You can create a new Color object using a constructor that takes the red,
green, and blue values as integers as shown below.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
Color myColor = new Color(255,30,120);
</pre></div>

<p>What do you think you will see if you modify the beach picture in the images folder to set all the blue
values to zero? Do you think you will still see a beach? Run the main method in the Picture class.
The body of the main method will create a Picture object named beach from the
"beach.jpg" file, open an explorer on a copy of the picture (in memory), call the method that sets
the blue values at all pixels to zero, and then open an explorer on a copy of the resulting picture.</p>
<p>The following code is the main method from the Picture class.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
public static void main(String[] args)
{
   Picture beach = new Picture("beach.jpg");
   beach.explore();
   beach.zeroBlue();
   beach.explore();
}
</pre></div>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li><p>Open <strong>PictureTester.java</strong> and run its <strong>main</strong> method. You should get the same results
as running the main method in the Picture class. The PictureTester class contains
class (static) methods for testing the methods that are in the Picture class.
</p></li>
<li><p>Uncomment the appropriate test method in the <strong>main</strong> method of <strong>PictureTester</strong> to test
any of the other methods in Picture.java. You can comment out the tests you don't want
to run. You can also add new test methods to PictureTester to test any methods you
create in the Picture class.</p></li>
</ol></div>

<p>The method <strong>zeroBlue</strong> in the <strong>Picture</strong> class gets a two-dimensional array of <strong>Pixel</strong> objects
from the current picture (the picture the method was called on). It then declares a variable that will refer
to a Pixel object named pixelObj. It uses a nested for-each loop to loop through all the
pixels in the picture. Inside the body of the nested for-each loop it sets the blue value for the
current pixel to zero. Note that you cannot change the elements of an array when you use a for-each
loop. If, however, the array elements are references to objects that have methods that allow changes,
you can change the internal state of objects referenced in the array (pixels).</p>

<p>The following code is the <strong>zeroBlue</strong> method in the <strong>Picture</strong> class.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public void zeroBlue()
{
   Pixel[][] pixels = this.getPixels2D();
   for (Pixel[] rowArray : pixels)
   {
      for (Pixel pixelObj : rowArray)
      {
         pixelObj.setBlue(0);
      }
   }
}
</pre></div>
	
<div id="csList">
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Using the zeroBlue method as a starting point, write the method <strong>keepOnlyBlue</strong> that
will keep only the blue values, that is, it will set the red and green values to zero. Create a class
(static) method to test this new method in the class PictureTester. Be sure to call the new
test method in the main method in PictureTester.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the <strong>negate</strong> method to negate all the pixels in a picture. To negate a picture, set the red
value to 255 minus the current red value, the green value to 255 minus the current green value
and the blue value to 255 minus the current blue value. Create a class (static) method to test this
new method in the class PictureTester. Be sure to call the new test method in the main
method in PictureTester.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the <strong>grayscale</strong> method to turn the picture into shades of gray. Set the red, green, and
blue values to the average of the current red, green, and blue values (add all three values and
divide by 3). Create a class (static) method to test this new method in the class
PictureTester. Be sure to call the new test method in the main method in
PictureTester.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge</strong> - Explore the "water.jpg" picture in the images folder. Write a method
<strong>fixUnderwater</strong> to modify the pixel colors to make the fish easier to see. Create a class
(static) method to test this new method in the class PictureTester. Be sure to call the new
test method in the main method in PictureTester.
