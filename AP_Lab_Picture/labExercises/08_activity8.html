<h1>Creating a Collage</h1>
<p>You can copy one picture to another by copying the color from the pixels in one picture to the pixels in
the other picture. To do this you will need to keep track of the row and column information for both the
picture you are copying from and the picture you are copying to, as shown in the following copy
method. The easiest way to do this is to declare and initialize both a fromRow and toRow in the
outer for loop and increment them both at the end of the loop. A for loop can have more than
one variable declaration and initialization and/or modification. Just separate the items with commas.
Note that the inner loop has both a fromCol and a toCol declared, initialized, and incremented.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
public void copy(Picture fromPic, int startRow, int startCol)
{
   Pixel fromPixel = null;
   Pixel toPixel = null;
   Pixel[][] toPixels = this.getPixels2D();
   Pixel[][] fromPixels = fromPic.getPixels2D();
   for (int fromRow = 0, toRow = startRow;
        fromRow < fromPixels.length && toRow &lt; toPixels.length;
        fromRow++, toRow++)
   {
      for (int fromCol = 0, toCol = startCol;
           fromCol < fromPixels[0].length && toCol < toPixels[0].length;
           fromCol++, toCol++)
      {
         fromPixel = fromPixels[fromRow][fromCol];
         toPixel = toPixels[toRow][toCol];
         toPixel.setColor(fromPixel.getColor());
      }
   }
}
</pre></div>
<p>You can create a collage by copying several small pictures onto a larger picture. You can do some picture
manipulations like zero blue before you copy the picture as well. You can even mirror the result to get a
nice artistic effect (Figure 11).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/PictureLab16.png"></div>

<p>The following method shows how to create a simple collage using the <strong>copy</strong> method.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
public void createCollage()
{
   Picture flower1 = new Picture("flower1.jpg");
   Picture flower2 = new Picture("flower2.jpg");
   this.copy(flower1,0,0);
   this.copy(flower2,100,0);
   this.copy(flower1,200,0);
   Picture flowerNoBlue = new Picture(flower2);
   flowerNoBlue.zeroBlue();
   this.copy(flowerNoBlue,300,0);
   this.copy(flower1,400,0);
   this.copy(flower2,500,0);
   this.mirrorVertical();
   this.write("collage.jpg");
}
</pre></div>
<p>Notice that the <strong>Picture</strong> method <strong>write</strong> can be used to save a copy of the final collage to your disk
as a JPEG picture file. You can also specify the full path name of where to write the picture
("c:\temp\collage.jpg"). Be sure to include the extension (.jpg) as well so that your
computer knows the file type.</p>
<p>You can test this with the <strong>testCollage</strong>method in <strong>PictureTester</strong>.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Create a second <strong>copy</strong> method that adds parameters to allow you to copy just part of the
fromPic. You will need to add parameters that specify the start row, end row, start column,
and end column to copy from. Write a class (static) test method in PictureTester to test
this new method and call it in the main method.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>myCollage</strong> method that has at least three pictures (can be the same picture) copied
three times with three different picture manipulations and at least one mirroring. Write a class
(static) test method in PictureTester to test this new method and call it in the main
method.</p></li>
