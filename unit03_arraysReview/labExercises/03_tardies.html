<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>A teacher in your school has asked you to write a program to track the number of tardies students
   in her class have accrued during the semester. The program should begin by allowing the teacher to
   enter student information from the keyboard. This information should include the student's last
   name, first name, and number of tardies. The program should allow for a maximum of 50 students,
   however the teacher should be allowed to enter less than that number. Once the data entry process
   is complete, the program should print a summary of class tardies. This summary should include the
   total number of tardies for her class and a list of all students in the database. Refer to the the
   sample output below.</p>
   
<h3>Class Decomposition</h3>
<p>The problem has been decomposed into 2 classes: Student and Tardies. The <strong>Student</strong> class is responsible
   for storing the information for a single student. This class has been provided for you with
   appropriate instance variables, constructors, accessor methods, mutator methods, and a toString
   method. The <strong>Tardies</strong> class is a client of the Student class. It is responsible for
   maintaining a list of students, entering and
   managing the student information, including tardies, and for displaying the summary report.</p>
  <p>Copy the following code into a file named <strong>Student.java</strong></p>
  <div id="csCode">
  <pre>
public class Student
{
    // Instance Variables
    private String lastName;

<h1>Modifications</h1>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li>Implement <strong>enterData</strong> method. This method populates the students array with
    Student objects from keyboard input. The input consists of a student's last name, first name, and
	number of tardies. The data entry should continue until the senitel value is input. The variable numStudents should be updated to reflect the logical size of
	the student array.</li>
<li>Implement <strong>getTotalTardies</strong> method. This method returns the count of the
    total number of tardies for all students in the class.</li>
<li>Implement <strong>summaryReport</strong> method. This method prints a summary report which
    includes the total number of tardies for the entire class and a list of names and tardies
    for every student in the class. Appropriate labelling should be included.</li>
