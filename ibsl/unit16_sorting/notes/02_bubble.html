<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
<p>The bubble sort is the oldest and simplest sort in use. Unfortunately, it's also the slowest.
   The bubble sort works by comparing the first two elements in the list. If the second is larger
   than the first, the two are swapped. It then compares the second and third item in the list,
   and these too are swapped if necessary. When you are done with one pass, you have bubbled 
   the largest item to the end of the list. The next time through the list, you compare item
   0 through n - 1. That is, you start over, bubbling up the next-largest item in the list,
   comparing it in turn with every item except the last item. When you are done with the
   second pass, the largest and second-largest items are in place.</p>
   
<h1>Bubble Sort Efficiency</h1>
<p>The bubble sort is generally considered to be the most inefficient sorting
   algorithm in common usage. Under best case conditions (the list is already sorted), 
   the bubble sort can approach a constant O(n) level of complexity. Average case is O(n<sup>2</sup>). </p>

<p>While the insertion and selection sorts also have O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexities, they are
   significantly more efficient than the bubble sort.</p> 

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simplicity and ease of implementation.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Horribly inefficient.</p>
