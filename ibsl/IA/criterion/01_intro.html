<div id="csContent"> 	
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The requirement of the internal assessment is to develop a solution for a specified client to a specified problem or an unanswered question.
   The solution is assessed using five criteria.</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
		<li>Planning</li>
		<li>Solution overview</li>
		<li>Development</li>
		<li>Functionality and extensibility of product</li>
		<li>Evaluation</li>
   </ul></div>
<h3>Key Terms</h3>
<p>The term <strong>"solution"</strong> refers to all the work submitted by the student for the internal assessment; the term 
  <strong>"product"</strong> refers to the completed software only. The product is a subset of the solution.</p>

<h1>Choose Topic</h1>
<p>In identifying a problem, students can select any topic that interests them. It does not have to be directly related to
   the specified themes in the syllabus or to the option studied. Students should undertake a challenging task using appropriate
   techniques to showcase their algorithmic thinking and organizational skills.</p>

<p>The solution may take one of these forms:</p>
<div id="csList">
	<ul>
		<li><p>Creating a new system, such as an OOP program, a relational database, a simulation or a stand-alone/ web-based application</p></li>
		<li><p>Adding functionality to an existing system, such as connecting a webpage(s) to a database, writing a function for Moodle,
			 writing a plug-in, or developing a stand-alone application</p></li>
	</ul></div>
<p>It is essential that whatever form the solution takes it ensures the student can explicitly <strong>demonstrate</strong> and <strong>document</strong> his
   or her <strong>algorithmic thinking skills</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important that students choose an issue that: </p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>engages their interest</p></li>
<li><p>meets the criteria for assessment</p></li>
<li><p>involves a client and/or adviser who is accessible and can provide feedback within the required time frame</p></li>
<li><p>is realistic in terms of resources, their technical ability and the time frame for completion.</p></li>

<br><br>
</ul></div>

<h1>Choose Client/Advisor</h1>
<p>The term <strong>"client"</strong> refers to the person for whom the product is being developed. The student may also be the client.</p>
<p>The term <strong>"adviser"</strong> refers to a third party the student must identify to assist him or her in the development of the product.</p>

<p>There are three scenarios for the development of the product.</p>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li><p>The student is developing the product for a third party who is the client and also acts as the adviser.</p></li>
<li><p>The student is developing the product for a third party who is the client. Another person acts as the adviser.</p></li>
<li><p>The student is the client (developing the product for himself or herself). An appropriate adult must act as the adviser. </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Students will need to work closely with the adviser throughout the development of the solution. Therefore it is recommended 
  that wherever possible, students select an adviser who is known to them or their family. This could include members of the school 
  community, local clubs or businesses.</p>
  
<h3>Role of the Adviser</h3>

<p>The adviser should provide guidance to the student as suggested below.</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>Advise on the scope and feasibility of the solution to ensure that a non-trivial solution is developed.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss possible success criteria with the student.</p></li>
<li><p>Advise during the development of the product.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm whether the success criteria have been met.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<h1>Word count and format</h1>
<p>These word count figures in the table below are guidelines.</p>
<p>The overall word limit for the solution is 2,000; however, it is possible to
   complete the solution in 1,500&nbsp;words without a significant loss of quality.</p>
  <p>If students write extended prose in the sections where the word count does not
    apply, these words will be counted in the overall word count.</p>
  <p>It is strongly recommended that the documentation is submitted in a commonly used
   format such as a PDF. </p>
