<p>*The success criteria identified in criterion A will be used in criterion D to evaluate the effectiveness of the product.</p>
<p>Criterion A should include the following:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Description of the Scenario</li>
<li>Rationale for proposed solution</li>
<li>Success criteria</li>
</ul></div>
<h1>Description of the Scenario(problem)</h1>
<p>The following key questions should be considered.</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Who is the client/adviser?</li>
<li>Is the choice of client/adviser appropriate?</li>
<li>Why is the product being developed?</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Students may use a range of methods to gather information from the client and/or adviser. It must be remembered that evidence of the consultation must be included in the final submission of the solution.</p>
<p>Students will need to interview their client to determine the success criterion. This interview needs to be included in the appendix A.

<h1>Rationale for proposed solution</h1>
<p>The rationale behind the choice of the proposed product must be in extended writing, with reference
to the student's consultations with the client and/or adviser, justifying how the choice of this particular
product is an effective solution.</p>
<p>Before reaching a decision for the proposed product the student and/or computer science teacher must
determine:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>if the student has the technical skills and access to the software required to develop the product</li>
<li>whether the client's hardware and software is compatible with the product</li>
<li>if the data required for the product can be obtained by either the student and/or appropriate third
parties</li>
<li>how any security implications for the development and operation of the product can be resolved.</li>
</ul></div>

<h1>Success criteria</h1>
<p>The success criteria describe what the program is suppose to accomplish.</p>
<p>The success criteria (that are evaluated in criterion E) should be listed in the form of <strong>bullet points</strong>.
If the student is the client, they must have an adviser who can review the success criteria and provide the
validation of the product.</p>
