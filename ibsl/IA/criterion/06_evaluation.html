<p>This criterion should be completed as two parts.</p>
<h1>Evaluation of the product</h1>
<p>The evaluation of the product should refer directly to the success criteria in criterion A, feedback from the
client/adviser, as well as any other appropriate feedback obtained.</p>
<h1>Recommendations for the future development of the product</h1>
<p>The student will use the feedback and the evaluation of the specific performance criteria to recommend
possible future developments to the product. These recommendations should explain the benefits of these
developments.</p>
