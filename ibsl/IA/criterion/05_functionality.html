<h1>Assessment Criterion D: Functionality and Extensibility(4 marks)</h1>
<p>This criterion assesses the extent to which the product:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>functions, as evidenced in the video</p></li>
<li><p>can be expanded and modified by future users as evidenced in the design and development documentation.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<td>0</td>
<td>The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.</td>

<td>1-2</td>
<td>The video shows that the product functions partially. Some expansion and modification of the product is possible but difficult.
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3-4</td>
<td>The video shows that the product functions well. Some expansion and modifications of the product are straightforward.

<p>This criterion should be completed as two parts and does not require any additional written documentation.</p>
<h1>Functionality of the product</h1>
<p>The student must use the video to demonstrate the product functioning. This evidence will be supported,
where possible, by the product on the CD-ROM/DVD or USB.</p>

<h1>Extensibility of product</h1>
<p>The student should design the product so that it can be maintained by another party and/or be further
developed. Therefore the design of the product should include appropriate folder and data structures,
intuitive file and/or class naming conventions and, where appropriate, comments in the code.</p>
