There is no explanation of why the techniques are used or how they are adequate for the task. Sources are used but are not identified.

It is characterized by some appropriate use of existing tools. There is some attempt to explain the techniques used and why they are adequate for the task. All sources are identified.

<p>The product must be compatible with the information in criterion A and criterion B.</p>
<p>The student must present a list of the techniques used in developing the product.</p>
<p>The techniques may include algorithmic thinking, data structures, software tools and user interface. This list
need not be exhaustive but should illustrate how the major components of the product were developed.
The student must provide evidence of algorithmic thinking.</p>
<p>The information in the development documentation must provide a detailed account, using extended
writing and other appropriate information, to explain the following.</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>The structure of the product and why it is appropriate</p></li>
<li><p>The algorithmic thinking used in the development of the product</p></li>
<li><p>The techniques used in the development of the product and reasons why they are appropriate to it
(may include screenshots, exemplar data, reference to information in the appendix)</p></li>
<li><p>Any existing tools that are used in the development of the product, such as code libraries, software
packages, web hosting, security information or infrastructure issues</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Any reference material such as templates, program code, applets or other materials that have been used
or modified must be acknowledged in this criterion. The code used in the product can be included in the
appendix.</p>
