<h1>What is a System?</h1>
<p>A <strong>system</strong> is a set of interacting parts that operate together to achieve some objective or purpose.</p>
<p>A system has three stages</p>

<ol>
<br>
<li>Something feeds into the system (the <strong>input</strong>).</li>
<li>The system does something with the input (the <strong>process</strong>).</li>
<li>The process gives a result (the <strong>output</strong>).</li>

<h3>Digestive System</h3>
<p>We are surrounded by all sorts of systems. There are electrical systems, irrigation systems, telephone systems, economic systems,
   distribution systems, etc. In fact, we actually have quite a few systems inside our own bodies including the digestive system, endocrine system,
   immune system, lymphatic system, muscular system, nervous system, reproductive system, respiratory system, nervous system,
   skeletal system, and urinary system.</p>
<p>Take the digestive system as an example. It follows the three stages shown above:</p>

<h1>Computer System</h1>
<p>A <strong>computer system</strong> can be defined as a system of interconnected computers that share a
   central storage system and various peripheral devices such as a printers, scanners, or routers. 
   Each computer connected to the system can operate independently, but has the ability to communicate
   with other external devices and computers.</p>
<p>A computer system follows the input-process-output model:</p>
