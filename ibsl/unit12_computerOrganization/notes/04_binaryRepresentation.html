<h1>Binary Representation</h1>
<div id="ib">2.1.9 Define the terms: bit, byte, binary, denary/decimal, hexadecimal.</div>
<p><strong>bit</strong> - a digit in the binary number system. A bit is one of two values: 0 or 1.</p>
<p><strong>byte</strong> - a unit of measurement in computing. 1 byte =  8 bits.</p>
<p><strong>denary/decimal</strong> - a number system based on ten digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The decimal number
   system, also known as base 10, is the most popular number system in the world.</p>
<p><strong>hexadecimal</strong> - a number system based on sixteen digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. The hexadecimal
   number system, also known as base 16, is often used as a more condensed way of representing binary numbers.</p>
<div id="ib">2.1.10 Outline the way in which data is represented in the computer.</div>

<p>All data in the computer is represented as binary numbers.</p>
