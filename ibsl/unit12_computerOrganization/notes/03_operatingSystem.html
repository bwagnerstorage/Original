<h1>Operating System</h1>
<div id="ib">2.1.6 Describe the main functions of an operating system.</div>
<p>An <strong>operating system</strong> is a software program that provides an interface between the
user and the computer and manages application software installed on the computer.
Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Unix are examples of operating systems.<p>

<p>The operating system, typically stored on a hard drive, is automatically loaded into memory as soon as you
turn on, or boot, the computer. The term booting refers to the process of loading an operating system into a computer's memory. 
</p>

<h3>Basic Functions of any Operating System</h3>
<p>Every computer has an operating system and, regardless of the size and complexity of
the computer and its operating system, all operating systems perform the same basic functions:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p><strong>Managing Resources</strong> - The operating system coordinates all the computer's
resources including keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor, storage devices and
memory.</p>
<p>An operating system creates a file structure on the computer hard drive where
user data can be stored and retrieved. When a file is saved, the operating
system saves it, attaches a name to it, and remembers where it
put the file for future use. The way an operating system
organizes information into files is called the <strong>file system</strong>.</p>
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Providing a User Interface</strong> - Users interact with application programs and computer hardware
through a user interface. Almost all operating systems today provide a windows-like Graphical
User Interface (GUI) in which graphic objects called icons are used to represent commonly used
features.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running Applications</strong> - The operating system loads and runs applications such as word processors and
games. Most operating systems support multitasking, or the ability to run more than one
application at a time. When a user requests a program, the operating system locates the
application and loads it into the primary memory or RAM of the computer. 
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support for Built-In Utility Programs</strong> - The operating
system uses utility programs for maintenance and repairs.
Utility programs help identify problems, locate lost files,
repair damaged files, and backup data. 
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control to the Computer Hardware</strong> - The operating system sits between the programs and the
Basic Input Output System (BIOS). The BIOS controls the hardware. All programs that need
hardware resources must go through the operating system. The operating system can either access
the hardware through the BIOS or through the device drivers.
</p></li>
</ul></div>


<h1>Application Software</h1>
<div id="ib">2.1.7 Outline the use of a range of application software.</div>

<p><strong>Application software</strong> consists of programs designed to perform specific tasks for users. Examples of application software
 include word processors, spreadsheets, database management systems, email, web browsers, computer-aided design (CAD), games, and 
 graphic processing software. Specific application software products, called <strong>software packages</strong>, are available from software
  vendors. Although application software also is available as shareware, freeware, and public-domain software, these usually
   have fewer capabilities than retail software packages.</p>

<div id="ib">2.1.8 Identify common features of applications.</div>

<p>A graphical-user interface (GUI) provides several common features that application software incorporate. These common
   features include things like menus, buttons, toolbars, ribbons, icons, and sliders. </p>
   
   <p>Application software typically provides a save option.</p>
