<h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
<div id="ib">2.1.1 Outline the architecture of the central processing unit (CPU) and the functions of the arithmetic logic unit
                   (ALU) and the control unit (CU) and the registers within the CPU.</div>
				   
<p><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> -  the key component of a computer system, which contains the circuitry necessary to
    interpret and execute program instructions.</p>
<p>As there are a great many variations in architecture between the different kinds of CPU, we shall look at a simplified model of the
   structure. This simplified model consists of five parts, which are: </p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
   <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)</li>
   <li>Control Unit(CU)</li>
   <li>Registers</li>
   <li>System Buses</li>
   <li>Memory</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <div align="center"><img src="images/cpu1.png"></div>
   
   <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
<p>The part of the central processing unit that deals with operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication of integers 
    and Boolean operations. It receives control signals from the control unit telling it to carry out these operations.</p>
	
<h3>Control Unit (CU)</h3>
<p>This controls the movement of instructions in and out of the processor, and also controls the operation of the ALU. 
It consists of a decoder, control logic circuits, and a clock to ensure everything happens at the correct time. It is also 
responsible for performing the instruction execution cycle.</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a very small amount of very fast memory that is built into the CPU in order to speed up its operations by
   providing quick access to commonly used values. All processors include some common registers used for specific functions. Below is a list 
   of some of the most common ones along with their purposes:</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
   <li><p><strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong> - this register holds the memory address of the next instruction that is to 
     be executed.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Instruction Register (IR)</strong> -  this register holds the instruction being executed by the CPU.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Accumulator (AC)</strong> - this register holds the result of operations performed by the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).</p></li>
	<li><p><font color="#FF0000">Memory Address Register (MAR)</font> - this register holds the memory addresses of data and instructions.
	   It is used to access data and instructions from memory during the execution phase of an instruction. Suppose the CPU wants to store some
	   data in memory or read data from memory. It would place the address of the requested memory location in the MAR.
	   The MAR is directly connected to the RAM chips on the motherboard via the address bus.</p></li> 
	<li><p><font color="#FF0000">Memory Buffer Register (MBR)</font> - this register holds the contents of data or instructions read from, or written
	   to memory. It is used to store data/instructions coming from memory or going to memory. The MBR is directly connected to the RAM chips 
	   on the motherboard via the data bus.</p></li>
   </ul></div>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/cpu2.png"></div>
   
<h3>System Bus</h3>
<p>The system bus is comprised of the control bus, data bus and address bus. It is used for connections between the processor,
   memory and peripherals, and transferal of data between the various parts. This occurs through physical connections such as cables
   or printed circuits.</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
   <li><p><strong>Control Bus</strong> - a system bus that is used by the CPU to communicate with other devices within the computer.
      The control bus usually carries commands from the CPU and returns status signals from the devices.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Address Bus</strong> - a system bus that establishes a connection between the CPU and memory which carry the address
    to/from which the CPU wishes to read or write. An address bus is measured by the amount of memory a system can retrieve. 
	A system with a 32-bit address bus can address 4 gibibytes(2^30) of memory space. Newer computers using a 64-bit address bus with a
	supporting operating system can address 16 exbibytes(2^60) of memory locations, which is virtually unlimited.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Data Bus</strong> - a system bus that carries data to/from the cpu, memory, and peripherals.</p></li>
   </ul>
   </div>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>The memory is not an actual part of the CPU itself, and is instead housed elsewhere on the motherboard. 
   However, it is here that the program being executed is stored, and as such is a crucial part of the overall structure
   involved in program execution.</p>


<div id="ib">2.1.2 Describe primary memory.</div>
<p><strong>Primary memory</strong> is computer memory that is accessed directly by the CPU. This includes several types of memory, 
   such as the processor cache and system ROM. However, in most cases, primary memory refers to system RAM.</p>
   <p>RAM, or random access memory, consists of one or more memory modules that temporarily store data while a computer is running.
   RAM is volatile memory, meaning it is erased when the power is turned off. Therefore, each time you start up your computer, 
   the operating system must be loaded from secondary memory (such as a hard drive) into the primary memory, or RAM. Similarly, 
   whenever you launch an application on your computer, it is loaded into RAM.</p>
   <p>The operating system and applications are loaded into primary memory, since RAM can be accessed much faster than storage devices.
   In fact, the data can be transferred between CPU and RAM more than a hundred times faster than between the CPU and the hard drive.
   By loading data into RAM, programs can run significantly faster and are much more responsive than if than constantly accessed data
   from secondary memory.</p>

<h3>RAM (random access memory)</h3> 
  <p>RAM is a temporary (Volatile) storage area utilized by the CPU. Before a program 
    can be ran the program is loaded into the memory which allows the CPU direct 
    access to the program.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/ram.jpg"></div> 

<h3>ROM (read-only memory)</h3>
<p>Computers almost always contain a small amount of read-only memory that holds instructions for starting up the computer. 
  Unlike RAM, ROM cannot be written to. It is non-volatile which means once you turn off the computer the information is still there.</p>
 <div align="center"><img src="images/rom.jpg"></div> 
 
<h3>PROM (programmable read-only memory)</h3> 
<p>A PROM is a memory chip on which data can be written only once. Once a program has been written onto a PROM, 
  it remains there forever. Unlike RAM, PROM's retain their contents when the computer is turned off. The difference between a
  PROM and a ROM (read-only memory) is that a PROM is manufactured as blank memory, whereas a ROM is programmed during the
  manufacturing process. To write data onto a PROM chip, you need a special device called a PROM programmer or PROM burner.
  The process of programming a PROM is sometimes called burning the PROM.</p> 

<h3>EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory)</h3> 
<p>A special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light. Once it is erased, it can be reprogrammed.
   An EEPROM is similar to a PROM, but requires only electricity to be erased.</p> 

<h3></h3>EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
<p>Pronounced double-ee-prom, an EEPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it 
  to an electrical charge. Like other types of PROM, EEPROM retains its contents even when the power is turned off. 
  Also like other types of ROM, EEPROM is not as fast as RAM.</p>

<h3>Two Types of RAM</h3>
<p><strong>SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)</strong> is a type of memory that is faster and more reliable than the more
  common DRAM (dynamic RAM). The term static is derived from the fact that it doesn't need to be refreshed like dynamic RAM.</p> 
<p>Because of its cost SRAM is often used only as a memory cache usually found in the CPU (L1, L2 and L3 Cache).</p>

<p><strong>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)</strong> is a type of inexpensive memory used in most personal computers.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/memory1.png"></div>

<div id="ib">2.1.3 Explain the use of cache memory.</div>
<p><strong>Cache memory</strong> is small high-speed memory that improves the performance of a CPU by storing needed data closer - in both time and distance - to where it's needed.</p>
<p>A microprocessor can access cache memory more quickly than it can access regular RAM. As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first
  in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading
   of data from larger slower memory.</p>
<p>Cache memory is sometimes described in levels of closeness and accessibility to the microprocessor. An L1 (Level 1) cache is on the same chip as
   the microprocessor. L2 (Level 2) is usually a separate static RAM (SRAM) chip. The main RAM is usually a dynamic RAM (DRAM) chip.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/cache1.png"></div>

  <p>With cache memory it is all about speed. L1 cache can be accesses at the 
    same speed as the processor is running. L2 cache is approximately half as 
    fast as L1. DRAM Memory is approximately half as fast as L2.</p>
<p>Many modern microprocessors employ a third cache memory called the L3 cache. It is between the L2 cache and DRAM Memory.</p>

  <p>A good example of the application of caching can be found in a school library. 
    Suppose a history teacher is bringing her class to the library to research 
    the Civil War. Before the class arrives the librarian pulls some popular books 
    from the shelves that are about the Civil War and places them on a cart. When 
    the class arrives the students first look on the cart for a book they would 
    like to use. If they cannot find the book they want they can go to the shelves 
    to find the book themselves. The cart is a cache providing quick access to 
    the books.</p>
   
<p>In addition to cache memory, one can think of RAM itself as a cache of memory for hard disk storage since all of RAM's contents
   come from the hard disk initially when you turn your computer on and load the operating system (you are loading it into RAM) and
   later as you start new applications and access new data. RAM can also contain a special area called a <strong>disk cache</strong> that contains the
   data most recently read in from the hard disk. </p>

<div id="ib">
    <p>2.1.4 Explain the machine instruction cycle.</p></div>
    <p>Each time the CPU executes an instruction, it takes a series of steps. 
      One round of steps from getting an instruction back to getting the next 
      instruction is called the <strong>Machine Cycle</strong>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>The Machine Cycle</h3>
	<div id="csList">
	<ul>
      <li><p><strong>Fetch</strong> - get an instruction from cache or memory</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Decode</strong> - translate it into computer commands (machine language)</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Execute</strong> - actually process the command</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Store</strong> - write the result to memory</p></li>
	 </ul></div> 
	  
      <div align="center"><img src="images/machinecycle.png"></div>
	  
      <h3>Speed</h3>
     <p> The immense speed of the computer enables it to do millions of such steps 
      in a second. In fact, MIPS, standing for millions of instructions per second, is one 
      way to measure computer speeds.</p>
