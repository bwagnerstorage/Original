<h1>Distributed Systems</h1>
<div id="ib">7.1.7 Compare a centrally controlled system with a distributed system. </div>

<p>A <strong>centrally controlled system</strong> is a system in which there is no networking. All aspects of the application are hosted
   on one machine and users directly connect to that machine. The classic mainframe time-sharing system is an example of this type of system.
   In this setup terminals are connected directly to a mainframe computer where all processing occurs.</p>
   
<p>A <strong>distributed system </strong>is a collection of independent computers linked by a network that appear
 to users of the system as a single computer. The Internet is example of this type of system. When users access the Internet they are not
 connecting to one centralized computer; instead they are connecting to a network of computers where the resources and processing power of
 these computers can be utilized.</p>

<div id="csNote"><strong>Distributed computing</strong> refers to multiple computer systems working on a single problem.
 In distributed computing, a single problem is divided into many parts, and each part is solved by different computers. As long as the computers
  are networked, they can communicate with each other to solve the problem.</div>

<p>The ultimate goal of distributed computing is to maximize performance by connecting users and IT resources in a cost-effective, transparent
 and reliable manner. It also ensures fault tolerance and enables resource accessibility in the event that one of the components fails.</p>
 
<p>Some of the major drawbacks to a distributed network include network bandwidth requirements, security, and software complexity.</p>

<p>The main problem with the centralized model is that it is not easily scalable. There is a
limit to the number of CPUs in a system and eventually the entire system needs to be
upgraded or replaced. A centralized system has a problem of multiple entities contending
for the same resource.</p>

<div id="ib">7.1.8 Outline the role of autonomous agents acting within a larger system.</div>

<p>An <strong>autonomous agent</strong> performs functions within an environment to achieve specific goals, without being directed to do so. 
Some computer programs act as autonomous agents, as do advanced robotics, examples of artificial life, and computer viruses.</p> 

<p>Generally, it is necessary for an agent to be able to use reasoning to interact with a system.
This includes the ability to sense information, process it, and in some cases manipulate it. An autonomous agent also needs to
behave purposefully to accomplish a particular goal.</p>

<p>An example of an autonomous agent in software could be something like a supply chain management program. The program looks at
aspects of the supply chain and can engage in activities like ordering and moving supplies, scheduling personnel, and requesting
trucks. These activities all facilitate a larger goal of keeping the supply chain moving in an organized fashion. This differs 
from an automated system that can react simplistically; perhaps it orders new supplies when a factory starts to run low, for example,
in response to a trigger in the programming.</p>


<p>Multiple agents can act within a single system and may be cooperative or independent of each other. In robotics, interactions
of autonomous agents can be important. They can use sensors to pick up visual input, sounds, and other input from the environment.
This information can be coordinated across the system to complete tasks like grasping and manipulating items. Systems can also learn
from their experiences to develop more refined functions and work with each other to accomplish goals.</p>

<p>Applications for this research are particularly important in fields like artificial life, the development of complex robotics, and
advanced computer programs. A truly autonomous agent <strong>doesn't require direction from an external source</strong> like a programmer or another
utility, and can undertake complex tasks. Automation of this nature can save workers hours, as the program may be able to complete 
activities effectively without involving workers. Automated medical billing, for instance, generates bills and documentation without 
the need for an experienced staff member to handle this task.</p>
