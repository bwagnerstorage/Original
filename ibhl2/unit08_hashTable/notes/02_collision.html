<h1>Resolving Collisions</h1>
<p>In a hash table a collision occurs when two data items hash to the same location within the array. In this section we look at several methods for dealing with collisions.</p>
<br>
<h3>Linear Probing</h3>

<p>When inserting data into a hash table the simplest way to resolve a collision is to search the array, starting form the collision spot, and find the first available empty position - referred to as linear probing.</p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash9.gif"></div>

<p>When a search reaches the last position of the array, the search wraps around to continue from the first position. If we assume the array does not become full 
  and that an array cell is null when unoccupied, the code for insertions is as follows:</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
  // get the initial hash code
int index = hashCode(data, array.length);

// stop searching when an empty cell is encountered
while(array[index] != null)
{
   // increment the index and wrap around to first position if necessary
   index = (index + 1) % array.length;
}
// an empty cell is found, so store the item
array[index] = item;</pre></div>

<p>Retrievals and removals work in a similar manner, except that we search for an item that matches the target item.</p>

<p>Linear collision processing is prone to a problem known as <strong>clustering</strong>. This situation occurs when the items that cause a collision
   are relocated to the same region (a cluster) within the array. This placement usually leads to other collisions with other relocated items. During the
   course of an application, several clusters may develop and combine into larger clusters, making the problem worse.</p>
<br>
<h3>Quadratic Collision Processing</h3>

<p>One way to avoid the clustering associated with linear collision processing is to advance the search for an empty position a considerable 
  distance from the collision point. Quadratic collision processsing accomplishes this by incrementing the current index by the square of a constant
  on each attempt. If the attempt fails, we increment the constant and try again. Put another way, if we begin with an initial has code k and a constant c,
   the formula used each pass is k + c<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Following is the code for insertions, updated to use quadratic collision processing:</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>

// set the initial has code, index, and constant
int hashCode = hashCode(data, array.length);
int constant = 2;
int index = hashCode % array.length;

// stop searching when an empty cell is encountered
while(array[index] != null)
{
   // increment the index and wrap around to first position if necessary
   index = (hashCode + constant * constant) % array.length;
   constant++;
}
// an empty cell is found, so store the item
array[index] = item;</pre></div>

<br>
<h3>Chaining</h3>

<p>In a collision processing strategy known as chaining, the items are stored in an array of linked lists, or chains. 
  Each item's hash code locates the <strong>bucket</strong>, or index, of the chain in which the item already resides or is to be inserted.
  The retrieval and removal operations each perform the following steps:</p>

<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Compute the item's hash code or index in the array.</p></li>
<li><p>Search the linked list at the index for the item.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>If the item is found, it can be returned or removed. The figure below shows an array of linked lists with five buckets and eight items.</p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash10.gif"></div>

<p>The hash code of each item is the index of its linked list in the array. For example, the items D7, D3, and D1 have the hash code 4.</p>

<p>To insert an item's hash code or index in the array.</p>
<div id="csList"><ol>
 <li><p>  Compute the item's hash code or index in the array.</p></li> 
  <li><p> If the array cell is empty, create a node with item and assign the node to the cell.</p></li>
  <li><p>  Otherwise, a collision occurs. The existing item is the head of a linked list or chain of items at that position. Insert the new item at the head of this list.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Using the ListNode class, following is the code for inserting an item using chaining:</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
// get the hash code
int index = hashCode(data, array.length);

// access a bucket and store the item at the head of its linked list
array[index] = new ListNode(item, array[index]);
</pre></div>
