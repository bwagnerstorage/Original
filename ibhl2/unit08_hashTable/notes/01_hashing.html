<h1>Hashing</h1>
<p>A <strong>hash table</strong> is an ADT that provides a way of mapping any object (a key) to an associated object (a value). This mapping is very efficient for both adding objects 
  to the data structure and retrieving objects from the data structure. Both the adding and retrieving work on the order of constant time O(1).</p>

<p>A hash table is made up of two parts: an array (the actual table where the data to be searched is stored) and a mapping function, known as a <strong>hash function</strong>. 
   The hash function is a mapping from the input space to the integer space that defines the indices of the array. In other words, the hash function provides a way for assigning
   numbers to the input data such that the data can then be stored at the array index corresponding to the assigned number.
   Let's take a simple example. First, we start with a hash table array of strings (we'll use strings as the data being stored and searched in this example). Let's say the hash table size is 12: </p>
   
   <div align="left"><img src="images/hash1.gif"></div>
   
   <p>Next we need a hash function. There are many possible ways to construct a hash function. We'll discuss these possibilities more in the next section.
      For now, let's assume a simple hash function that takes a string as input. The returned hash value will be the sum of the ASCII characters that make 
	  up the string mod(%) the size of the array (It is important to finish the hash function with a mod operation. This insures that the calculated array
	  index will be within the lower and upper bounds of the array indices):</p>
  
  <div id="csCode"><pre>
// hash function
public int hashCode(String str, int array_size)
{
   int sum =0;
   for(int i=0; i < str.length(); i++)
   {
      sum += (int)str.charAt(i);   // sum characters
   }
   return sum % array_size;        // perform mod
}</pre></div>

<p>Now that we have a framework in place, let's try using it. First, let's store a string into the table: "Steve".</p>

<p>We run "Steve" through the hash function, and find that hashCode("Steve",12) yields 3.</p>

<p>We insert it into the hash table: </p>

 <div align="left"><img src="images/hash2.gif"></div>
 
 <p>Let's try another string: "Spark". We run the string through the hash function and find that hashCode("Spark",12) yields 6.</p>

<p>We insert it into the hash table:</p> 

 <div align="left"><img src="images/hash3.gif"></div>
 
 <p>Let's try another: "Notes". We run "Notes" through the hash function and find that hashCode("Notes",12) is 3.</p>

<p>We insert it into the hash table: </p>

 <div align="left"><img src="images/hash4.gif"></div>
 
 <p>Ikes! What happened? A hash function doesn't guarantee that every input will map to a different output. Because of the nature of the hash function
    there is always the chance that two inputs will hash to the same output. This indicates that both elements should be inserted at the same place in
   the array, and this is impossible. This phenomenon is known as a <strong>collision</strong>.</p>
<p>There are many algorithms for dealing with collisions, such as <strong>linear probing</strong> and <strong>chaining</strong>. While each of the methods has its advantages, 
   we will only discuss chaining here.</p>
<p>Chaining requires a slight modification to the data structure. Instead of storing the data elements right into the array, they are stored in linked lists.
   Each slot in the array then points to one of these linked lists. When an element hashes to a value, it is added to the linked list at that index in the array.
   Because a linked list has no limit on length, collisions are no longer a problem. If more than one element hashes to the same value, then both are stored in that linked list.</p>
<p>Let's look at the above example again, this time with our modified data structure: </p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash5.gif"></div>

<p>Again, let's try adding "Steve" which hashes to 3: </p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash6.gif"></div>

<p>And "Spark" which hashes to 6: </p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash7.gif"></div>

<p>Now we add "Notes" which hashes to 3, just like "Steve": </p>

<div align="left"><img src="images/hash8.gif"></div>

<p>Once we have our hash table populated, a search follows the same steps as doing an insertion. We hash the data we're searching for, go to that place in the array,
 look down the list originating from that location, and see if what we're looking for is in the list. The number of steps is O(1).</p>
<p>Chaining allows us to solve the problem of collision in a simple yet powerful manner. Of course, there are some drawbacks. Imagine the worst case scenario where
 through some fluke of bad luck and bad programming, every data element hashed to the same value. In that case, to do a lookup, we'd really be doing a straight linear
 search on a linked list, which means that our search operation is back to being O(n). The worst case search time for a hash table is O(n). However, the probability of 
 that happening is so small that, while the worst case search time is O(n), both the best and average cases are O(1).</p>

<p>We will look more closely at strategies for collision resolution in the next section.</p>
