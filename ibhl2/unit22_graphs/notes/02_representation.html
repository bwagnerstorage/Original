  <div id="csHeader">Graph Representation</div>
  <div id="csContent">
  <p>Every graph has two components, <strong>nodes</strong> and <strong>edges</strong>. For the rest of
     our discussion I will be using the word "Node" instead of "Vertex". 
     Letâ€™s see how these two components can be implemented in Java.</p> 

  <h1>Nodes</h1>
  <p>A node is an end point in a graph. Depending upon the problem, nodes can be implemented as a single value like an integer or 
     string or by more complex data such as an object. 
     As an example, a node can be represented as an object of a class like the one shown below.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>class Node
{
  String value;   
  int nodeId;
  Node parent;          
  int distanceFromSource;
  
  public Node(String v, int id, Node p)
  {
    value = v;
    nodeId = id;
    parent = p;
  }
}
</pre></div>
<p>Note: Since most of the graph problems my students see are during programming competitions, I have
   temporarily abandoned some OOP design principles in favor of simplicity and speed.</p>
   <br>
<h1>Edges</h1>
<p>Edges represent the connection between nodes. There are two ways to represent edges.</p>

<h2>Adjacency Matrix</h2>  
An Adjacency matrix is a two dimensional array that can be used to represent the relationship between
nodes in a graph or the edges. 
<h3>Sample 1 - 2D Array representation of an undirected unweighted graph.</h3>
<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph5.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:35%; height:35%">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph6.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">"T" means true, "F" means false</p>
<p>Each "T" in the matrix represents an edge that exists between two nodes. To interpret the matrix, start by looking at the
   first row of the matrix labelled "A". This "A" represents node A in the graph. All "T"s   
   signify that an edge exists between the A node and a node specified by the corresponding column.
   For example, on the A row there is a "T" at column B and at column C. This implies that node A
   has the following set of edges: {AB, AC}.
</p>
<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph7.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph8.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
</div>
<p>Since this matrix is representative of a undirected graph then the edge relationship between two
   nodes is bi-directional. This means that not only is there a path from A to B but there also exists a path
   from B to A. If you were to cut the matrix in half by drawing a line diagonally across the grid 
   from the top left corner to the bottom right corner you would see that the two halves are mirror
   images of each other. Therefore, if you look at first column of the matrix which also represents node A
   you will notice that there is a "T" at row B and at row C.
</p>
<img src="images/Graph/graph9.png" style="display:block; width:9%; height:9% padding-left:30px">
<p>Since the graph in this example was not weighted I chose boolean values to represent the edges.
   Other programmers may use 0 and 1 to represent this relationship, especially if they have a C language background.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Sample 2 - 2D array representation of a directed weighted graph.</h3>
<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph11.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:35%; height:35%">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph10.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
</div>
<br>
<p>In a directed graph arrows show which direction the path or paths flow
   from node to node. To interpret this relationship in a 2D array you only need to look at the rows.
   The matrix shows that node A has two edges AB and AC. Since the flow is in one direction the
   reverse relationship does not exist. The numbers between the nodes are the weights or cost of going
   from one node to another.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Adjacency List</h2>  
<p>The second method used to represent a graph is an <strong>Adjacency List</strong>.
   An adjacency list is traditionally implemented as an array of linked lists. The array size is
   equal to the number of nodes or vertices in the graph. The linked list is used to store the
   edges.</p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph12.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
    <img src="images/Graph/graph6.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
  </div>
  <br><br>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
      <img src="images/Graph/graph13.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
      <img src="images/Graph/graph10.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; height:50%">
  </div>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Libraries and Collection Classes</h2>
  <p>If the nodes of the graph problem have simple data like numbers or strings
     then the examples shown above will do fine, but what if a node contains more complex data? For example,
     some problems require you to keep track of information like the node value, the parent of a node,
     the distance from the source node to the current node, etc. This is where the <strong>Node</strong>
     class discussed above comes in handy. Instead of creating an adjacency matrix that contains integers or
     strings make a 2D Array of Nodes, for example<br>
     <div id="csCode"><pre>Node[][] adjacencyMatrix = new Node[numVertices][numVertices];</pre></div>
     <p>or for an adjacency list do the following</p>
     <div id="csCode"><pre>LinkedList&lt;Node&gt;[] adjacencyList = new LinkedList[numVertices];</pre></div>
     <p>The Node class can be customized to fit the needs of the problem.</p>
     <p>Most high-level languages today contain libraries of ready made data structures or collections
        called ADTs (Abstract Data Types). Your adjacency list does not have to be an array of linked lists.
        Here are two examples of adjacency list's made by Java's <strong>TreeMap</strong> and <strong>HashMap</strong> classes. For example,<br>
        <div id="csCode"><pre>Map&lt;Integer, LinkedList&lt;Node&gt;&gt;adjacencyList = new HashMap<&gt;();</pre></div>
        <p>or</p>
        <div id="csCode"><pre>Map&lt;Node, LinkedList&lt;Node&gt;&gt;adjacencyList = new TreeMap<&gt;();</pre></div>
     </p>
     <p>I must point out that using a Node class is not the only way to keep track of the data used in a particular
        problem. Another way, is to create parallel arrays, where each array stores a piece of the data needed to
        solve the problem. For example,
        it is very common to see a boolean array called <strong>visited</strong> used in graph algorithms. This array keeps track of the
        nodes that have already been visited as you traverse a graph so that you don't keep revisiting the same nodes. As you can
        probably guess, that would be bad. 
     </p>
  
  <h2>Adjacency Matrix vs Adjacency List</h2>
  <p>So which technique is best? Generally speaking it is easier to program an adjacency matrix than it is an 
     adjacency list, so if a graph problem is simple with a simple data set then an adjacency matrix
     is a good chose, on the other hand, if the problem is more difficult with a complex data set I tend to
     use an adjacency list. One thing to consider when choosing between the two is that the 
     adjacency matrix tends to use more memory than the adjacencyList. In reality, both techniques can be used to solve
     graph problems, so it often boils down to personal preference. You should use the technique that you feel most 
     comfortable.
