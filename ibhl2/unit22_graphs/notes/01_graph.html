    <p>A <strong>tree</strong> is a hierarchical data structure in which each element or node is connected to
       one or more nodes beneath it. A tree has the restriction that a child node can only have one
       parent. A tree is a special type of graph.</p>
    <img src="images/Graph/tree.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:40%">

    <p>In simplest terms a <strong>graph</strong> consists of elements (normally referred to as vertices or
        nodes) connected by links (also known as edges). Unlike trees, in graphs, a node can have many parents.
        Here is an example of a graph.</p>

    <img src="images/Graph/graph4.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%">
    <p>The graph above contains the following sets of vertices and edges:<br>
       V = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G}<br>
       E = {AB, AC, BE, BF, CE, DE, DF, DG, EF, FG}<br>
    </p>

    <h1>Classifications of Graphs</h1>
    <p>There are several common types of graphs</p>
    <ul id="csList">
      <li style="font-size:1.2em; font: weight 500; padding-bottom:10px">Directed or undirected</li>
      <li style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight:500; padding-bottom:10px">Weighted or unweighted</li>
      <li style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight:500; padding-bottom:10px">Cyclic or acyclic</li>
    </ul>
     <br>
    <h2 style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:600; padding-bottom:10px">Directed or Undirected</h2>
    <p>Graphs can be classified by whether or not their edges have direction.</p>
    <ul id="csList">
        <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> each edge can be traversed in either direction</li>
        <li><strong>Directed Graph:</strong> each edge can be traversed only in a specified direction, typically
            denoted by an arrow.</li>
    </ul>
       <img src="images/Graph/graph1.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%">

    <h2 style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:600; padding-bottom:10px">Weighted or Unweighted</h2>
    <p>Graphs can be classified by whether or not their edges have weight.</p>
    <ul id="csList">
        <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> edges have a weight assigned to them. This weight typically shows the cost of traversing.<br>
          Example:  distances between cities on a map</li>
        <li><strong>Unweighted Graph:</strong> edges have no weight. The edges simply show connections.<br>
          Example: high school course prerequisites 
          </li>
    </ul>
      <img src="images/Graph/graph3.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:80%">

   
      <h2 style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:600; padding-bottom:10px">Cyclic or Acyclic</h2>
      <p>Graphs can be classified by whether or not they have cycles. A cycle is a
          path through a graph that ends at the same vertex where it originally started.
      </p>
      <ul id="csList">
          <li><strong>Cyclic Graph:</strong> graph contains one or more cycles</li>
          <li><strong>Acyclic Graph:</strong> graph contains no cycles</li>
      </ul>

<h1>Graph Problems</h1>

    <p>Graphs are good in modeling real world problems like representing cities which are connected by roads and finding the paths between cities, modeling air traffic controller system,
    and representing networks like the Internet. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
    Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.</p>


<h1>Recognizing a Graph Problem</h1>
<p>The first key to solving a graph related problem is recognizing that it is a graph problem. 
   If you see the problem involves a grid or network of some kind that can be a clue that it 
   might be a graph problem. Secondly, if you are required to find a path of
   any sort, it is usually a graph problem as well. Finally, some common keywords associated with graph
   problems include: vertices, nodes, edges, connections, connectivity, paths, cycles and direction.
   An example of a description of a simple problem that exhibits some of these characteristics is
   shown below.</p>

   <h2 style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:600; padding-bottom:10px">Sample Graph Problem</h2>

<p> Kolt has moved to a new town and he has to walk to his new school. His school is directly behind his 
    house but there is a 100 acre patch of woods between them. Kolt has decided to see if he can
    find a shortcut to school through the woods so it does not take him as long to get to school.
    He found his house on Google Maps and noticed that the patch of woods is in a square shape
    and there is a creek along one side of the woods and a road on the other.</p>

    <p>Write a program that simulates this scenario. Given a 10 x 10 2-dimensional <strong>grid</strong> marked with the letters
    'H', 'X', 'T', 'C', 'R' and a '.'. The 'H' represents Kolt's house, the starting point. The 'X' is his school,
    the ending point. 'T' represents trees, the 'C' represents the creek, the 'R' represents the road, and
    the '.' represents open areas were he can walk. He can walk horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Find the <strong>minimum</strong> number of steps it takes Kolt
    to find a <strong>path</strong> from his house to his school. There exists at least one path through the woods.</p>

<p>This is an example of a shortest path problem which is one type of problem graphs are often used
   to solve.
