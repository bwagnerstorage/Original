    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>There are two principal techniques for implementing backtracking algorithms: one uses stacks and the other recursion. In this assignment we explore the use of stacks for backtracking algorithms. A backtracking algorithm begins in a predefined starting
        state then moves from state to state in search of a desired ending state. At any point along the way, when there is a choice between several alternative states, the algorithm picks one, possibly at random, and continues. If the algorithm reaches
        a state representing an undesirable outcome, it <strong>backs up</strong> to the last point at which there was unexplored alternative and tries it. In this way, the algorithm either exhaustively searches all states, or it reaches the desired ending
        state. The role of a stack in the process is to remember the alternative states that occur at each juncture.</p>
    <p>A classic example of this backtracking algorithm is the process of finding a way through a maze. In this version of the problem, a mouse must find a path through a maze that will allow him to exit the maze on the other side. When he reaches a dead
        end he must backtrack to find another route through the maze.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Below is the partial implementation a program that utilizes a design technique called the <strong>model/view pattern</strong>. In general, it is a good idea to divide the code for most interactive applications into two sets of classes. One set of
        classes, which we call the <strong>view</strong>, handles the interactions with the human users, such as input and output operations. The other set of classes, called the <strong>model</strong>, represents the data used by the application. One
        of the benefits of this separation of responsibilities is that one can write different views for the same data model, such as terminal-based view and a graphical-based view, without changing a line of code in the data model. Alternatively, one
        can write different representations of the data model without altering a line of code in the views. In the program that follows the view portion of the program is contained in a class named <strong>MazeView</strong> and the model portion is in
        a class named <strong>MazeModel</strong>.</p>

    <p>6. Your assignment is to implement the method
        <font color="#FF0000">searchMaze</font>
        located in the <strong>MazeModel</strong> class. You will need to use a stack in your implementation. The <em>MazeModel</em> class contains a two-dimensional array of String objects. Each cell within the array can contain one of the following
        objects: a path, a wall, a track, the exit, or the mouse itself. Each of these objects are represented within the array as a String object. Each object is assigned a value in the Constants section of the <em>MazeModel</em> class. Here are their
        declarations:
    </p>

    <div id="csCode"><pre>// Constants
public final String EXIT = "X";
public final String WALL = "W";
public final String PATH = "P";
public final String MOUSE = "M";
public final String TRACK = "T";</pre></div>

    <p>Before the simulation begins the mouse is inserted into the maze at a random location on its right boundary. The exit is randomly selected on the left boundary of the maze. The rest of the maze is randomly filled with either wall or path objects.
        The mouse can only move to cells within the array that contain path objects. To start the simulation the mouse searches the maze for a path that is adjacent to its starting location and is within the boundaries of the maze. If a path is found,
        the mouse moves to that location and its previous position is marked as a track. From its new location the mouse again searches for a path that is adjacent to its location and is within the boundaries of the maze. If a path cannot be found (it
        is surrounded by walls and or tracks) then the mouse backtracks to its previous position and searches for a different path. This process of searching, moving, or backtracking is repeated until either the exit is found or the mouse returns to its
        starting position with no paths left to search.</p>
    <p>The <em>searchMaze</em> method is responsible for finding a path through the maze. It is called at each time step of the simulation. The method is responsible for moving the mouse and sending the view one of the moving notifications: SEARCHING, EXITFOUND,
        NOEXITFOUND. These notifications are declared as constants withing the <em>MazeModel</em> class:</p>

    <div id="csCode"><pre>// Constants
public final int SEARCHING = 0;
public final int EXITFOUND = 1;
public final int NOEXITFOUND = 2;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>If the mouse finds a valid path from its current location or it backtracks to a previous location it notifies the view by sending a still SEARCHING message. If the mouse finds the exit it sends a EXITFOUND message. If the mouse backtracks to its starting
        position and all paths from that position have been tried it sends a NOEXITFOUND message.</p>
