    <h1>QUEUE ADT</h1>
    <p>Like stacks, <strong>queues</strong> are linear collections. However, insertions in a queue are restricted to one end, called the rear, and removals are restricted to the other end, called the front. A queue thus supports a First-In, First-Out protocol
        (FIFO). Queues occur in everyday life from checkout lines in stores, to highway tollboth lines, and airport baggage check-in lines. A queue is used whenever people or things are lined up for processing on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

    <p>Queues have two fundamental opertions: add, which adds an item to the rear of a queue, and remove, which removes an item from the front. (The traditional names of these operations are <strong>enqueue</strong> and <strong>dequeue</strong>)</p>



    <p>The illustration below demonstrates the functionality of a queue.</p>

    <h1>Special Implementations of a Queue</h1>
    <h3>Priority Queue</h3>
    <div id="csList">
        <ul>
            <p> A <strong>priority queue</strong> is a collection of elements that each element has been assigned a priority such that order in which elements are deleted and processed comes from the following rules:<br>
                <li>An element of higher priority is processed before any element of lower priority.</li>
                <li>Two element with the same priority are processed according to the order in which they were added to the queue(FIFO behavior).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>A good example of a priority queue is the emergency room at a hospital. As patients enter the emerency room they are placed on a waiting list queue, however patients with more serious injuries are moved to the front of the list.</p>
    <h3>Circular Queue</h3>
    <p>A <strong>circular queue</strong> is a queue with a finite capacity (limited to a fixed number of items). When the number of items in the circular queue is less than the capacity, it behaves as a normal queue. However, when the queue is full, new
        items added to the queue overwrite the older items.</p>
    <p>A good visual image of a circular queue is a merry-go-round.</p>

    <h1>Applications of Queues</h1>
    <div id="csList">
        <ul>
            <p>Applications of queues in computer science are numerous. Following are just a few examples:

                <li>Multitasking operating system - operating systems often maintain a queue of processes that are ready to execute or that are waiting for a particular event to occur.</li>
                <li>Buffer - computer systems must often provide a "holding area" for messages between two processes, two programs, or even two systems. This holding area is usually called a "buffer" and is often implemented as a queue. </li>
                <li>Storing client service requests in a web server</li>
                <li>Printer queue - printers store job requests in queues so that first job sent to the printer is first job printed.</li>
                <li>Simulations - programs that attempt to model real-world phenomenon.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Java Collections Framework(JCF)</h1>
    <p>The developers of the JCF decided not to include a Queue class in the framework, instead to create a queue you use the LinkedList class which implements the Queue interface. Because of this implementation decision the add and remove methods of the
        LinkedList class are used instead of the more traditional queue operations enqueue and dequeue.</p>

    <strong>interface java.util.Queue&ltE&gt</strong>

    <table id="csTable">
        <tr>
            <td width="150px">boolean add(E obj)</td>
            <td>enqueues obj at the end of the queue; returns true</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E remove()</td>
            <td>dequeues and returns the element at the front of the queue</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E peek()</td>
            <td>returns the element at the front of the queue; null if the queue is empty</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>boolean isEmpty()</td>
            <td>returns true if queue is empty; false otherwise</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <h1>Using a Queue</h1>

    <p>To create a queue use the LinkedList class which implements the Queue interface.</p>

    <strong>Creating a Linked List Object</strong>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; queue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();  // create queue
</pre></div>
    <p>or</p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
List&lt;Integer&gt; queue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();        // create queue
</pre></div>
    <p><strong>Adding an Object to a Queue</strong></p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
queue.add(57);  // adds item to rear of queue
</pre></div>
    <p><strong>Removing an Object from a Queue</strong></p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
int num = queue.remove();  // removes item from front of queue
</pre></div>
    <p><strong>Viewing the Top of a Queue</strong></p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
int num = queue.peek();  // does not remove the item
</pre></div>
    <p><strong>Traversing a Queue</strong></p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>
while(!queue.isEmpty())
{
   System.out.println(queue.remove());
}
</pre></div>
