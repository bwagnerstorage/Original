<h3>Abstract Data Type(ADT)</h3>
<p>One of the essential features of a computer is its ability to store and manipulate data. Computer programs often need to store large amounts of data 
   and one way to accomplish this is to use an array.
   An array is very useful, however, it has many deficiencies, one of which is its requirement of a fixed size. For this reason, computer scientists have developed
   other ways to store data in programs called Abstract Data Types.</p>
<p>An <strong>Abstract Data Type(ADT)</strong> is a description for a collection of data and a set of operations that act on the data. These data types are <strong>abstract</strong> because they only
   describe what can be done to the data not how it is done. The actual implementation of these ADTs is done through the construction of data structures. A <strong>data structure</strong> is 
   the physical implementation of an ADT. In Java, these data structures are implemented as classes.</p>
   
    <div id="csNote">An <strong>ADT</strong> describes the common actions/methods of a data structure but the implementation details are not known. That is left to the implementing data structure or class.</div>
	
<strong>Common Operations</strong>
<p>There are three common operations that all ADTs share. They include:</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
   <li><strong>Add</strong> - add a data item to a collection.</li>
   <li><strong>Remove</strong> - remove a data item from a collection.</li>
   <li><strong>Retrieve</strong> - get a data item from a collection.</li>
   
   </ul>
   </div>
<p>How theses are operations are performed by the different ADTs depends on their implementation.</p>
   <p>Below is a list of some of the most common ADTs:</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
      <li>List</li>
	  <li>Bag</li>
	  <li>Set</li>
	  <li>Stack</li>
	  <li>Queue</li>
	  <li>Priority Queue</li>
	  <li>Tree</li>
	  <li>Heap</li>
	  <li>Hash</li>
	  <li>Map</li>
	  <li>Graph</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
 <p>For example, the List ADT describes a data structure that contains an ordered collection of values, where the same value may occur more than once.
    In Java, ADTs are represented through interfaces. Below is the partial specification for Java's List interface:</p>
 <div id="csCode">
 <pre>
public interface List
{
    int size()
    boolean add(E obj)
    void add(int i, E obj)
    E get(int i)
    E set(int i)
    E remove(int i)
}
</pre></div>
<p>This interface fullfills the specification for a List ADT by requiring any class that implements this interface to have an order collection of data that can be added, removed, retrieved, 
   and updated. Two of the classes(data structures) that implement the List interface are ArrayList and LinkedList. Both classes provide the operations
   specified in the List interface but how they store the data in the class and carry out the operations is done in two completely different ways.</p>
 <table id="csTable" width="500px">
 <tr>
   <th>ADT</th>
   <th>Data Structure(class)</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>describe what can be done to data</td>
   <td>implement how it is done</td>
 </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Logical(Abstract)</td>
   <td>Physical(Concrete)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>List interface</td>
   <td>ArrayList class and LinkedList class</td>
 </tr>
 </table>

<h3>Collection</h3>
 <p>A <strong>collection</strong> is a group of items forming a conceptual unit. In computer science collections are ADTs that have been grouped together. These ADTs are implemented through data structures.
    A collection is essentially a collection of ADTs.</p>
 <p>Below is a list of common collection categories. These categories describe how the data is organized in the collections:</p>
    <div id="csList">
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear:</strong> Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, ...</li>
	  <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Heaps, Trees, Hashes, ...</li>
	  <li><strong>Connected:</strong> Graphs</li>
	  <li><strong>Unordered:</strong> Sets, Bags, Maps, ...</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>Collection classes play an important role in almost every non-trivial program written today. For this reason most high-level languages provide collections through class libraries
      including the Java Collection Framework(JCF), C++ Standard Library, and .NET Framework.</p>
<div id="csNote">Libraries provide convenient and reliable implementations of common programming tasks.</div>
	<p>The Java Collection Framework(JCF) provides a set of classes and interfaces that implement the most commonly used ADTs. The diagram below shows the interfaces of the Collections Framework
	   and some of their implementations:</p>
	<div align="center"><img src="images/jcf.png" width="650px"></div>
<div id="ib">D.4.13 Explain the advantages of using library collections.</div>
<h3>Benefits of the Java Collections Framework</h3>
<p>The Java Collections Framework provides the following benefits:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces programming effort:</strong> By providing useful data structures and algorithms, the Collections Framework frees you to concentrate on the important parts of your program
   rather than on the low-level "plumbing" required to make it work.</li>
<li><strong>Increases program speed and quality:</strong> This Collections Framework provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms.</li>
<Li><strong>Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs:</strong>The standard collection interfaces provide consistency throughout the framework so it takes less time to learn.</Li>
<li><strong>Fosters software reuse:</strong> New data structures that conform to the standard collection interfaces are by nature reusable. 
   The same goes for new algorithms that operate on objects that implement these interfaces.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>In this unit we will only be focusing on four ADTs through the Java Collection Framework:</p>
   <div id="csList">
   <ul>
      <li>List</li>
	  <li>Stack</li>
	  <li>Queue</li>
	  <li>Tree</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
