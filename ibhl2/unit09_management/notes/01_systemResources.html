<h1>System Resources</h1>
<div id="ib">6.1.1 Identify the resources that need to be managed within a computer system.</div>

  <p>System resources are the components within a computer, both physical and 
    virtual, that are available to be used by the operating system and other applications. 
    The major resource types that need to be managed include</p>
<div id = "csList">

      <li>Secondary Storage (hard disk, usb drive, external hard drive)</li>
      <li>Network Connectivity (bandwidth)</li>
      <li>Internal Devices (graphics card, sound card)</li>

  <h3>SuperComputers</h3>
  <p>High performance computing machines designed to have extremely fast processing speeds. 
      Supercomputers have various applications, such as performing complex scientific calculations, modeling simulations, and rendering large amounts of 3D graphics.
	  Supercomputers cost a fortune to build and are expensive to maintain, which is why only a few exist in the entire world.
	  Manfacturers of supercomputers include Cray and IBM.</p>
   <p>SuperComputers are built with many high-speed processors. For example, the Cray XE6 SuperComputer is currently configured (Jan 2014) with 3072
      64-bit AMD Opteron 6300 Series processors providing up to 30.7 teraflops of processing power every second. The XE6 can be configured 
	  with up to 24.5 TB of system memory (RAM).</p>

  <h3>MainFrames</h3>
  <p>A mainframe is an ultra high-performance computer made for high-volume, processor-intensive computing. 
      They are typically used by large businesses, science, and government. In the hierarchy of computers,
	  mainframes are right below supercomputers. A mainframe can usually execute many programs simultaneously
	  at a high speed, whereas supercomputers are designed for a single process. Currently, the largest
	  manufacturers of mainframes are IBM and Unisys.</p>
	<p>The biggest distinction between mainframes and supercomputers is the type of problems they tackle. 
	   Each of these types of large computers is specially designed and optimized to perform a particular type of task, 
	   and to do it better than any other computer.</p>
     <p>Supercomputers are designed to work on types of problems whose primary constraint is calculation speed.
	    Mainframes, on the other hand, deal with problems constrained by input/output and which demand reliability
	    above all else. So while supercomputers are ideal for performing complex calculations on a large data set,
	    mainframes are well suited for performing thousands upon thousands of concurrent transactions. </p>

  <h3>Servers</h3>
  <p>A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local
     area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.</p>
   <p>Many types of servers exist, including web servers, 
	 mail servers, and file servers. Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server. For example, a Web server may
	 run Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS, which both provide access to websites over the Internet. A mail server may run a
	 program like Exim or iMail, which provides SMTP services for sending and receiving email. A file server might use Samba 
	 or the operating system's built-in file sharing services to share files over a network.</p>
	<p>While server software is specific to the type of server, the hardware is not as important. In fact, a regular desktop
	 computers can be turned into a server by adding the appropriate software. For example, a computer connected to a home network
	 can be designated as a file server, print server, or both.</p>
	 
	 <p>While servers can run on different types of computers, it is important that the hardware is sufficient to support the
	    demands of the server. For instance, a web server that runs lots of web scripts in real-time should have a fast processor
	    and enough RAM to handle the "load" without slowing down. A file server should have one or more fast hard drives or SSDs
	   that can read and write data quickly. Regardless of the type of server, a fast network connection is critical, since all 
	   data flows through that connection.</p>

  <h3>PCs</h3>
  <p>PCs (Personal Computers) are are what most of us use on a daily basis for work or personal use. A typical PC includes a
     system unit, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Most PCs today also have a network or Internet connection, as well as ports for
     connecting peripheral devices, such as digital cameras, printers, scanners, speakers, external hard drives, and other components.</p>

  <h3>Laptops</h3>
  <p>A laptop is a PC for mobile use. It integrates most of the
     typical components of a deskyop computer including a display, a keyboard, a pointing device such
	 as a touchpad, and speakers into a single portable unit.</p>

<div id="ib">6.1.3 Identify the limitations of a range of resources in a specified computer system.</div>

<p>For example, single processor computers may not be able to render 3D graphics effectively.</p>

<div id="ib">6.1.4 Describe the possible problems resulting from the limitations in the resources in a computer system.</div>

<p>For example, user time wasted if the primary memory is too small or processor speed inadequate.
Multi-access and multiprogramming environments should be considered as well as single-user systems.</p>
