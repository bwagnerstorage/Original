<h1>Role of Operating System</h1>
<div id="ib">6.1.5 Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.</div>

<p>A computer is a system composed of two major components: hardware and software. Computer hardware is the physical equipment. 
Software is the collection of programs that allows the hardware to do its job. Computer software is divided into two broad 
categories: the <strong>operating system</strong> and <strong>application programs</strong>. Application programs use the computer hardware to
solve users' problems. The operating system, on the other hand, manages application programs and controls access to hardware by users.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/operatingsystem1.png"></div>

<p>An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer's resources, such as the cpu, memory, 
secondary storage, and peripherals, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.</p>

<h2>Managing Resources</h2>

<div id="csList">
<p><strong>Processor Management</strong></p>
<p>An operating system manages the cpu by providing applications access to its processing capabilities.</p>
<p>In a multitasking operating system more than one program is capable of running at a time.  Today, most desktop, laptop, and tablet
   operating systems function with some type of multitasking operating system.

 <p>A multitasking operating system divides the available processor time among the threads or jobs that need it. 
    The operating system allocates a processor time slice to each thread it executes.
   The currently executing thread is suspended when its time slice elapses, allowing another thread to run. When the
   system switches from one thread to another, it saves the context of the current thread and restores the saved 
   context of the next thread in the queue.</p>

<p>The length of the time slice depends on the operating system and the processor. Because each time slice is small 
(approximately 20 milliseconds), multiple threads appear to be executing at the same time. This is actually the case
 on multiprocessor systems, where the executable threads are distributed among the available processors.  </p>

<p><strong>Memory Management</strong></p>
<p>Operating systems use RAM to store the data required for applications and other computer functions
	 to operate. Each computing activity that is ongoing has a certain amount of memory allocated to it, which the operating system
	  manages. In cases where an application attempts to do something that there is not enough memory for, an operating system can 
	  sometimes use virtual memory to carry out the required processing, by utilizing a section of hard disk memory and using it
	  as though it is RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Peripheral Management</strong></p>
<p>Peripheral devices are managed by the operating system through the use
   of drivers. Drivers are special system software that handle communication between the user and the hardware installed or attached to a computer.
   All input and output operations, although invoked by an application programs, are actually carried out by the operating system.</p>
</div>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>This is the part of the operating system that interacts with the user.
 There are three different types of user interfaces: command-line, menu-driven, and graphical-user interface.</p>
 
<h2>Application Software Services</h2>
<p>The operating system is responsible for executing application software when they are selected by a user. They also provided many services to
   application software. Here is a list of a few of these services:</p>
   <ul id="csList2"><p>
   <li>User Interface API</li>
   <li>Memory Allocation</li>
   <li>File Management</li>
   <li>Error Handling</li>
   <li>Batch Processing (print jobs)</li></p>
   </ul>

<div id="ib">6.1.7 Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, multitasking, virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling.</div>

<h2>Scheduling</h2>
<p>Operating system scheduling is the process of controlling and prioritizing messages sent to a processor. An internal operating system program,
  called the scheduler, performs this task. The goal is maintaining a constant amount of work for the processor, eliminating highs and lows in the
   workload and making sure each process is completed within a reasonable time frame.
<p>Since nearly every operation on a computer has at least a small amount of processor time involved, the processor can be a major source
  of slowdowns and bottlenecks. In order to alleviate the strain on the processor, and make sure tasks are completed in a timely manner, most
  operating systems use some form of task scheduling.</p>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Policies allow the operating system to implement specific configurations for users and computers.
   Policies are settings that control how the operating system works. You can use them to customize the user interface, 
   restrict access to certain areas, specify security settings, and much more. </p>


<h2>Multitasking</h2>
<p>In a multitasking operating system where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the operating system 
   determines which applications should run in what order and how much time should be allowed for each application
   before giving another application a turn.</p>

<h2>Virtual Memory</h2>

  <p>Virtual memory is a memory management technique that temporarily stores inactive parts of the content in RAM to a disk, 
  restoring it to RAM when quick access to it is needed. This allows software to operate as though the computer has more RAM than it actually does.
  A computer can utilize virtual memory to store features in a program that are rarely used so they do not take up RAM.</p>

  <br><a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/virtual-memory.htm" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF">http://www.howstuffworks.com/virtual-memory.htm</a>

<h2>Paging</h2>
 <p>Paging is a memory management technique where the operating system copies a certain number of pages from a storage device to main memory.
 When a program needs a page that is not in main memory, the operating system copies the required page into memory and copies another
 page back to the disk.</p>

<p>With paging the operating system reads data from secondary storage in blocks called pages, all of 
which have identical size. The physical region of memory containing a single page is called a frame. When paging is used, a frame does
 not have to comprise a single physically contiguous region in secondary storage. This approach offers an advantage over earlier memory
  management methods, because it facilitates more efficient and faster use of storage.</p>

<h2>Interrupt</h2>

<p>An interrupt is an event that alters the sequence in which the processor executes instructions. A peripheral device uses interrupts to
   notify the CPU when it is ready to send or receive data. Most operating systems today utilize interrupts to control the flow of execution in a computer system.</p>

<p>In general, there are two categories of interrupts: <strong>hardware interrupts</strong> and <strong>software interrupts</strong>. A hardware interrupt occurs, for example, when an 
I/O operation has occurred such as a keystroke on a keyboard or button click on a mouse. A software interrupt occurs when an application program 
terminates or requests certain services from the operating system.</p>
 
<p>It is the operating systems job to watch for interrupts. If an interrupt occurs the operating system calls on a program called an interrupt handler 
that prioritizes the interrupts and saves them in a queue if more than one is waiting to be handled. The operating system then
uses a scheduler to figure out which program to give control to next.</p>

<h2>Polling</h2>

<p>Polling is an alternative to interrupts. In polling a peripheral device is repeatedly checked by the CPU for readiness, and if it is not, the computer
   returns to a different task.</p>
   
<p>With polling the processor is responsible for checking peripheral devices to see if they are ready for data transfer. 
   With interrupts the devices are responsible for notifying the processor when they need to transfer data.</p>
   
<p>Both polling and interrupts have advantages and disadvantages so to be most efficient processors utilize both of them.
 A good example of polled input is mouse movement.  A mouse could produce thousands of 
interrupts a second when the user moves the mouse.  Therefore an operating system will poll the mouse to determine the 
current mouse position.  An example of interrupt-driven input would be a network interface controller (NIC).  A 
NIC has a small memory location called a buffer to accommodate input and output communication. Once the buffer 
receives a packet of data it requires the CPU to copy that packet to main memory before the next packet arrives 
and overwrites it.  So once a packet is received the NIC will interrupt the CPU so that the data can be removed from the
buffer into main memory and signal to the NIC that it's ok to continue receiving data.</p>

<p>A good example of a system that is both polled and interrupt driven is a keyboard.  The subsystem that
 accepts data from the keyboard generally just buffers the data for polling by the
CPU but can be programmed to generate interrupts as well.  The most famous use of this is the key combination 
Control-Alt-Delete, which sends an interrupt to the CPU.  This is why when a computer is busy 
or hung pressing this key combination will interrupt the system.</p>

<div id="csNote">The IB curriculum states, "Technical details as to how these
are carried out will not be required,
but it is expected that students will
be familiar with these techniques
and understand when and why
they are used."</div>

<div id="ib">6.1.8 Discuss the advantages of producing a dedicated operating system for a device.</div>

<p>An operating system designed for a single purpose is often called a <strong>dedicated operating system</strong>. It performs a specific purpose,
 such as controlling the environment in a building, controlling a gas pump, or opening and closing an automatic door. 
 Dedicated operating systems cannot be used to run other types of programs such as games or business software.</p>
 
 <p>Operating systems that are either found in embedded systems or in firmware embedded in hardware are considered to be dedicated operating systems.</p>
 
 <p>The table below lists advantages and disadvantages of dedicated operating systems.</p>
 
 <table id="csTable">
    <tr>
       <th>Advantages</th>
	   <th>Disadvantages</th>
    </tr>
	<tr>
       <td><strong>Size</strong> - code is written for specific devices therefore it is much smaller than general-purpose operating systems</td>
	   <td><strong>Cost</strong> - more expensive to design</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
       <td><strong>Speed</strong> - code is smaller and optimized for specific devices so it is much faster</td>
	   <td>Can only be used on the device for which it was designed</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
       <td><strong>Customizable</strong> - designed for specific devices therefore can be customized to meet the specific needs of particular devices</td>
	   <td></td>
    </tr>
 </table>

<div id="csNote">The IB curriculum states, "Advantages related to size, speed
and customization should be
considered.
For example, using a dedicated
operating system for a cell phone
rather than using a pre-existing
operating system."</div>

<div id="ib">6.1.9 Outline how an operating system hides the complexity of the hardware from users and applications.</div>

<p>The fundamental operation of the operating system is to abstract the hardware to the programmer and user. The operating system
   provides generic interfaces to services provided by the underlying hardware.</p>
<p>In a world without operating systems, every programmer would need to know the most intimate details of the underlying hardware
  to get anything to run. Worse still, their programs would not run on other hardware, even if that hardware has only slight differences.</p>
  
<p>Below are some examples of abstraction that are provided by the operating system:</p>
<div id="csList">
  <ul>
	<li><p><strong>File System</strong> - Secondary storage devices such as hard disks, DVDs, and USB drives all work differently at the physical level
	    but in an operating system's virtual world they all appear to be the same. The processes of opening and saving files on these devices
		is identical (e.g. letters assigned to each device).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> - an operating system provides a programming language called an API
	    that developers of applications use to standardize the features of application programs. One feature provided by the API is a GUI interface
		that provides controls like buttons, menus, ribbons, toolbars, and sliders that have the same look and feel within different applications.
	    This standardization makes it easier for users to use application programs.</p>
	    <p>APIs also abstract processes like printing. The printing process is the same for different application programs.
		   A user does not need to worry about things like what type of printer is connected to a computer. All they have to do is select print
		   from a menu and the operating system takes care of the details.</p>	
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>Virtual Memory</strong> - gives a user the illusion that they have unlimited memory at their disposal.
	   The details of the swapping of data from the hard drive to RAM is completely hidden from the user.</p></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="csNote">The IB curriculum  states, "Students should be aware of a
range of examples where operating
systems virtualize real devices, such
as drive letters, virtual memory,
input devices, the Java virtual
machine."</div>
