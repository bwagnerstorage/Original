<h1>NetBeans Workspace: <a href="apFreeResponse/WordSearchNB.zip" style="color:#00F; font-size:1.0em; font-weight:600;" >WordSearch</a></h1>

<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Open the NetBeans project provided and complete two methods of the WordSearch class named
   <strong>searchPuzzle</strong> and <strong>findWord</strong>. Your implementation needs to include
   a recursive solution.</p>
<h3>Method searchPuzzle</h3>
<p>This method, given a String parameter, searches a 2D array of characters looking for series of letters
   that match the given word. If a match is found the method returns a value of true; otherwise it returns
   false. This method should utilize the method <strong>findWord</strong> in its implementation.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="images/wordSearch1.png" style="width:40%"></div>
<h3>Method findWord</h3>
<p>This method recursively searches the 2D array looking for letters that are organized either horizontally, vertically, or match the the letters of keyword.
   The letters can be layed out in regular order or reverse order. The method has four parameters. The first parameter, word, contains the string for which the method is searching.
   The second and third parameters contain the row and column of the 2D array where the method begins its search. 
   The last parameter, index, contains the index of the letter in <strong>word</strong> that the method is currently searching. Utilize method <strong>inBounds</strong> in your implementation.
</p>
