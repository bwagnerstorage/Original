  <p>In approval voting there are at least two candidates and there are many
    voters. Each voter votes by submitting a <br>
    ballot that represents a set of candidates of whom the voter approves.
    The winner of the election is the candidate <br>
    that is listed on the most ballots, that is, the candidate who is approved
    by the most voters. </p>
  <p>For example, suppose there are four candidates: Chris, Jamie, Pat, and
    Sandy. Seven voters vote as follows (order is unimportant, each ballot
    represents the set of candidates chosen by that voter). </p>

  <p>In this example, Jamie is the winner. If more than one candidate is tied
    with the most votes, then we consider the set of such candidates to be
    the winning set for this election. For example, if Chris appeared on voter
    3&#8217;s ballot along with Pat, then Chris would tie Jamie with five
    votes and the winning set would be {Chris, Jamie}. </p>
  <p>We represent one voter&#8217;s ballot as a Set that contains the names
    (as Strings) of the candidates approved <br>
    by that voter. We represent the set of ballots for all voters in the election
    by the following partial class <br>
    declaration. </p>

   // precondition: each entry in ballotList is a Set representing

  <p></p>
  <p>(a) Write the <em>VoterBallots</em> constructor. The constructor creates
    the <em>Map</em> <em>voteCount</em> and initializes it <br>
    to hold one entry for each candidate that appears on at least one ballot
    in <em>ballotList</em>. The associated <br>
    value for each candidate is the total number of ballots on which that
    candidate appears. <br>
    A solution that creates an unnecessary new instance of a <em>List</em>
    or <em>Set</em> will not receive full credit. </p>
  <p>Complete the <strong>constructor</strong> below. </p>
  <div id="apCode"><pre>// precondition: each entry in ballotList is a Set representing
//     one voter's ballot
// postcondition: voteCount.get(candidate) is the total number of
//     times candidate appears on ballots in ballotList
public <strong>VoterBallots</strong>(List&lt;Set&gt; ballotList) </pre></div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>(b) Write the VoterBallots method <em>candidatesWithMost</em>.
    Method candidatesWithMost returns a Set of the name(s)
    of the candidate(s) in <em>voteCount</em> with the most votes. In writing
    method candidatesWithMost, you may call the private helper method
    <em>maxVotes</em>. Solutions that reimplement functionality provided by
    maxVotes<, rather than invoking maxVotes, will not receive
    full credit. A solution that creates an unnecessary new instance of a
    List or Set will not receive full credit. </p>
  <p>Complete method <strong>candidatesWithMost</strong> below. </p>
  <div id="apCode"><pre>// postcondition: returns a set containing the candidate(s)
// with the most votes
public Set&lt;String&gt; <strong>candidatesWithMost</strong>() </pre></div>
