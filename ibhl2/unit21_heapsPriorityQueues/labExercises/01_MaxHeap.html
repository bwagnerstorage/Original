      <p>Below is the definition of a class named <em>MaxHeap</em> that implements 
        an integer heap using the maxheap property. The method <em>insert</em> 
        is responsible for adding new items to the heap. The method <em>removeMax</em> 
        removes the largest item from the heap.</p>

      <p>In this assignment you are going to implement two methods of the <em>MaxHeap</em> 
        class: <strong>reheapUpward</strong> and <strong>reheapDownward</strong>. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Part (a)</strong> Implement the method <em>reheapUpward</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>The <em>insert</em> method adds new items to the end of the heap and 
        increases the size of the heap by one.<em> reheapUpward</em> is used by 
        the <em>insert</em> method to place the newly added item in its proper 
        location within the heap. It accomplishes this by advancing the new item 
        <strong>up</strong> the tree by continually swapping it with its parent 
        until an acceptable location has been found. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Part (b)</strong> Implement the method <em>reheapDownward</em>.</p>
      <p>After removing the largest item from the heap the <em>removeMax</em> 
        method transfers the last item in the heap to the vacated root position 
        and decreases the size of the heap by one.<em> reheapDownward</em> is 
        used by the <em>removeMax</em> method to place the new root in its proper 
        location within the heap. It accomplishes this by advancing the new root 
        <strong>down</strong> the tree by continually swapping it with its largest 
        child until an acceptable location has been found.</p><br>
      <h3>Heap Rules</h3>
      <p>In your implementation of the two methods you will need to use the following 
        rules used for determining the location of a node's relatives within an 
        array-based heap. <em>i</em> represents a node's current location within 
        the array.</p>
      <table id="apTable">
        <tr> 
          <td><strong>ITEM</strong></td>
          <td><strong>LOCATION</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Parent</td>
          <td>(i -1) / 2</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Left sibling, if there is one</td>
          <td>i -1</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Right sibling, if there is one</td>
          <td>i + 1</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Left child, if there is one</td>
          <td>i * 2 + 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Right child, if there is one</td>
          <td>i * 2 + 2</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">HeapSort</h3>

      <div id="csNote">Notice 
            that when the <em>removeMax</em> method is called it always removes 
            the largest item in the heap. If the number of calls made to the <em>removeMax</em> 
            method equals the size of the heap the resulting output would be a 
            list of numbers in descending order. This is the process used by the 
            sorting algorithm called the <strong>HeapSort</strong> which has a 
            fast execution time of O(n log n).
