      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The <strong>heap sort</strong> is one of the best general-purpose sorting 
        algorithms. Although somewhat slower in practice than a good implementation 
        of quicksort, it has the advantage of a worst-case O(n log n) runtime. 
        As a comparison, the quicksort has a worst-case runtime of O(n<sup>2</sup>). 
        The primary advantage of the heap sort is its efficiency. The execution 
        time efficiency of the heap sort is O(n log n). The memory efficiency 
        of the heap sort, unlike the other O(n log n) sorts, is constant, O(1), 
        because the heap sort algorithm is not recursive and sorts the data in 
        place(does not need extra memory to perform sort). As a comparison, the 
        mergesort requires O(n) extra space to perform a sort.</p>
      <p>The algorithm works in two stages. In the first stage, the data is made 
        into a heap. In the second stage, items are removed from the heap one 
        at a time and <strong>moved to the end of the array</strong>, where the 
        sorted data is accumulated.</p>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>In this assignment your are going to create a class named <em>HeapSort</em> 
        that implements the heap sort algorithm.</p>
      <p><strong>Part (a)</strong></p>
      <p>Implement a <em>static</em> method named <strong>sort</strong> that accepts 
        an integer array as a parameter. The <em>sort</em> method should sort 
        the array in ascending order using the heap sort algorithm. </p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <div id="csCode"><pre>int[] a = {50, 15, 83, 27, 65, 44};
HeapSort.sort(a);</pre></div>

      <p>In writing the <em>HeapSort</em> class you will need to include other 
        methods that will assist the <em>sort</em> method in performing the sort. 
        These helper methods will also need to be declared <em>static</em>.</p>
        *Use the methods from the <em>MaxHeap</em> assignment.</p>
