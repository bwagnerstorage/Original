<h1>Trees</h1>

<p>Trees are an important data structure with many applications in computer science. They provide an efficient way to both search and sort data.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A tree is a type of data structure in which each element is attached to one or more elements directly beneath it.
 The connections between elements are called <strong>branches</strong>. Trees are often called inverted trees because they are normally drawn with
 the root at the top. The elements at the very bottom of a tree (that is, those that have no elements below them) are called <strong>leaves</strong>.</p>
