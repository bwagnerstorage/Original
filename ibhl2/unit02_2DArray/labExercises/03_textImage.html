<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Write a program that displays a text image on the console window. The program starts by reading numbers from a data file and stores them in a
     2D array. The numbers read are in the range of 1 to 3 inclusive. To draw the image the program translates the numbers into symbols and then displays
	 the symbols on the screen. The number 1 is translated into the symbol "@ ", the number 2 is translated into the the symbol "+ ", and the number 3
	 is translated into the symbol "&nbsp;&nbsp;".</p>
  <p>Below is the contents of the data file:</p>

<h3>Method displayImage</h3>
<p>Write method displayImage. Given a 2D array <strong>displayImage</strong> displays a text image on the console window by 
   traversing the array in row/column order. Each cell of the array
   contains a number between 1 and 3 inclusive. If a cell contains
   a 1 the method displays "@ " on the screen. If a cell contains
   a 2 the method displays "+ " on the screen. If a cell contains
   a 3 the method displays "  &nbsp;" on the screen.</p>
   
<h3>Method displayUpsideDown</h3>
<p>Write method displayUpsideDown. Given a 2D array <strong>displayUpsideDown</strong> displays the text image upside down.</p>

<h3>Method enlarge</h3>
<p>Write method enlarge. Given a 2D array <strong>enlarge</strong> displays the text image twice the size of the
   original image. This is accomplished by displaying each row and column twice.</p>
