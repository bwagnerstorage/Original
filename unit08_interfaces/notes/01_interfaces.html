<h1>Interfaces</h1>
<p>In Java an <strong>interface</strong> is a set of methods that classes must incorporate into their design. 
Interfaces are similar to abstract classes in that they both contain abstract methods. They are different, however, in that interfaces can
only contain abstract methods and constants. They do not contain variables, constructors, and implemented methods.</p>

<div id="csNote" style="width:250px"><strong>Interfaces</strong> are not classes.</div>

Look at the following example of an interface.
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>interface</pre></div> Pet
{
   public abstract void eat();
}
</pre></div>
<p>To define an interface you use the keyword <strong>interface</strong> followed by the name of the interface. The methods declared in an interface must be both public and abstract.
In fact, if you do not include these modifiers the compiler will add them for you. For this reason, most programmers do not include them.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>interface</pre></div> Pet
{
   void eat();
}
</pre></div>
<p>Interfaces can also contain constants.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>interface</pre></div> Pet
{
   public final int NUM_MEALS = 2;
   
   void eat();
}
</pre></div>
<p>Again the public declaration for the constant is optional.</p>

<h1>Implementing Interfaces</h1>
<p>Interfaces are implemented by classes. Look at the Dog class below that implements the Pet interface.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Dog <div id="csHighlight"><pre>implements</pre></div> Pet
{   
   public void eat()
   {
       // code to eat
   }
}
</pre></div>
<p>To implement an interface a class uses the keyword <strong>implements</strong>. </p>
<p>Since the Dog class implements the Pet interface, it is <strong>required</strong> to implement the eat method.</p>
<p>The Cat class below also implements the Pet interface therefore it also implements the eat method.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Cat <div id="csHighlight"><pre>implements</pre></div> Pet
{   
   public void eat()
   {
       // code to eat
   }
}
</pre></div>
<p>Since interfaces are not classes they cannot be instantiated.
   The following code would cause a compile error.</p>

<div id="csCode">
<pre>Pet pet = new Pet();   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// error</pre></div>
</pre>
</div>

<h1>Purpose of Interfaces</h1>
<p>Interfaces are used in Java to establish a common interface among related classes. Implementing an interface allows
   a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class
   and the outside world. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface
   must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.</p>
   
<p>In the example above, both the Dog and Cat classes implement the Pet interface, therefore clients of these
   classes know they both contain an eat method.</p>

<h1>Implementing Multiple Interfaces</h1>

<p>When using inheritance in Java a class can only extend one parent class. Multiple inheritance is not allowed. Interfaces, however, are not classes
   and multiple implementations are allowed. As an example, the Dog class below now implements both a Pet and Security interface.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Dog implements Pet, Security
{   
    
}
</pre></div>
<p>Each interface is separated by a comma.</p>
<p>Classes can also implement interfaces in conjunction with extending a class.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Dog extends Animal implements Pet, Security
{   
    
}
</pre></div>
<br>
</div>
