<h1>finally Block</h1>
<p>Java recognizes that there may be code that must be run before your method exits. For example, if you create a network connection,
   allocate a Graphics object, or open a file during the course of your method, you must destroy the network connection, deallocate
   the Graphics object, or close the file when you are done. Failing to do so can cause what is known as a resource leak.</p>

<p>Typically, a program can open only so many network connections or files. These are called resources, and you have a limited 
  number of resources available. You conserve these resources by closing them when you are done with them. If you do not close them, 
  those resources are no longer available to the system. It is as if they leaked out of your program. Eventually, a resource leak can
  cause your program (or other programs!) to crash.</p>

<p>To make sure that situations, like the ones mentioned above, are delt with in your programs the Java framework includes
  a <strong>finally block</strong>. Code placed in the finally block is guaranteed to run whether or not an exception is caught.
  The code in the finally block is guaranteed to run if any portion of the try block is excuted, regardless of how the try block completes.</p>
