<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<p>There are some things you just cannot control. Users input badly formed data, systems run out of memory, disks fill, and memory fails. 
   The question is, how does your program respond? The Java programming language supports a mechanism for managing ususual, unavoidable,
   and undesirable circumstances called exceptions. An <strong>exception</strong> is an object that encapsulates the idea that something bad,
   something out of the ordinary, has happened to which you must respond.</p>

<p>One way to handle exceptions is for the program to crash. This is considered undesirable. Better than crashing is to inform 
   the user of the problem, save and close all open files, and exit gracefully. Even more desirable would be to notify the user,
   allow the user to rectify the problem, and then continue. Best of all would be to fix the problem silently, and not trouble the user at all.</p>

<p>Which of these strategies you employ will depend not only on your skill, but also on the conditions you encounter. 
  There are many problems that simply cannot be rectified without help from the user (who must, for example, delete files
  or close any open programs). There are other problems that cannot be fixed at all. Instead, the program must exit as cleanly
  as possible. This unit will consider all of these situations.</p>
