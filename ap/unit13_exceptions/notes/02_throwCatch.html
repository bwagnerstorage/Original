<h1>Throwing and Catching</h1>
<p>When your program runs into a problem that it cannot handle, it <strong>throws an exception</strong>. That exception is either caught
  (handled) or it goes unhandled. Unhandled exceptions cause the program to terminate.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how exceptions work, lets look at a program that prompts a user to enter in two integers and then calculates the
   quotient by dividing the two numbers. The program has a loop so that you can run the program with different sets of numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li>Create a java source file named <strong>DivideNoExceptions.java</strong>.</li>
<li>Copy the code below into the program and then compile the program.</li>
<li>Execute the program with the following pairs of numbers:<br>
<div id="csOutput"><pre>
dividend = 24
divisor = 8

dividend = 12
divisor = 0
</pre></div></li>
</ol>

public class DivideNoExceptions
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       DivideTester test = new DivideTester();
       Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
       String ans;
       
       do
       {
          test.getNumbers();    // get two numbers
          test.divide();        // calculate the quotient
          test.printResults();  // print the results
          
          System.out.print("Continue[Y/N]?");
          ans = keyboard.nextLine();
          System.out.println();
       } while(ans.equalsIgnoreCase("y"));
    }
}

class DivideTester
{
    private int dividend;
    private int divisor;
    private int quotient;
    
    public void getNumbers()
    {
       Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.print("Enter the Dividend-->");
       dividend = keyboard.nextInt();
       System.out.print("Enter the Divisor-->");
       divisor = keyboard.nextInt();
       System.out.println();
    }
    
    public void divide()
    {
       quotient = dividend / divisor;   
    }
    
    public void printResults()
    {
       System.out.println(dividend + " / " + divisor + " = " +  quotient);
       System.out.println();
    }
}
</pre></div>
<p>When you executed the program you should have gotten the following results</p>
<div id="csSampleRun"><pre>
Enter the Dividend-->24
Enter the Divisor-->8

24 / 8 = 3

Continue[Y/N]?y

Enter the Dividend-->12
Enter the Divisor-->0

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at DivideTester.Divide(DivideNoExceptions.java:42)
        at DivideNoExceptions.main(DivideNoExceptions.java:14)
</pre></div>

<p>When you entered the first two numbers the program printed the results of the integer division. 
  However, when you entered a value of 0 for the divisor with the second pair of numbers, you were asking
  the program to divide by 0. This raised an exception. Since the program did not handle the exception, 
  the <strong>program terminated</strong> with a somewhat helpful message that told you where you made your mistake. This
  approach is not considered an appropriate way to handle the exception.</p>

 
<h1>When an Exception is Thrown</h1>

<p>It is important to realize that the exception was thrown in the divide method at the point that the dividend was divided by the divisor:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void Divide()
{
   quotient = dividend / divisor;    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// exception thrown</pre></div>
}
</pre></div>
<p>Notice that the printResults method does not execute if an exception is thrown. Once the exception is thrown,
   processing stops and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for a catch block to handle the exception.</p>

<p>The first place the JVM looks is within the method where the exception was thrown. In the above example,
   none is found, so the JVM unwinds the stack and looks for a catch statement in the calling method, main. 
   None is found there either, so the stack continues to unwind. If no catch statement is found the program
   terminates with the default handler, which displays a stack trace as shown below:</p>

<p>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero at DivideTester.Divide(DivideNoExceptions.java:42)
   at DivideNoExceptions.main(DivideNoExceptions.java:14) The exception message indentifies the type of exception as an ArithmeticException. 
   Notice that you can see the unwinding of the stack in the error message: the exception was raised in the divide method, which was called
   by the main method. The line number at the end of each line helps to identify where the exception occurred and can aid in locating the source of the error.</p>

<h1>Catching Exceptions</h1>

<p>The general approach to handling code that might throw exceptions is to create a <strong>try/catch block</strong> using the try
   keyword and catch keyword. In the try block, you try to execute something that might throw an exception.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void divide()
{
   try
   {
      quotient = dividend / divisor;
   }     
}
</pre></div>
<p>In the catch block, you catch any exceptions that were thrown. The try/catch block sequence says to the compiler, in essence,
 "Try to run this code, which has the potential to throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, catch it and deal with it." 
 Since you know that the Divide method might throw an ArithmeticException, you can catch that kind of exception and handle it.
  (You will see later in this unit how to catch exceptions regardless of their type.)</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void divide()
{
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>try</pre></div>
   {
      quotient = dividend / divisor;
   }    
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>catch</pre></div>(ArithmeticException e)
   {
      System.out.println("***Division by 0 error");
   } 
}
</pre></div>
<p>If you modify the divide method with this try/catch block the program will no longer crash when you enter 0 
  for the divisor. Instead, the program displays the error message "***Division by 0 error".</p>

<h1>Throwing Exceptions</h1>

<p>It turns out that divide by 0 exceptions are thrown only for integer division. If you modify our program to use
 double, rather that int, no exception will be thrown when you divide by 0. The screen shot below shows the result of 
 dividing a double by 0.</p>
 
<div id="csSampleRun"><pre>
Enter the Dividend-->15
Enter the Divisor-->0

15.0 / 0.0 = Infinity

Continue[Y/N]?n
</pre></div>

<p>While this is convenient, you might choose not to allow division by 0, even with doubles. In that case,
  you can use the throw keyword to throw an ArithmeticException yourself if presented with divide by 0.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
if(divisor == 0)
{
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>throw</pre></div> new ArithmeticException();
}
</pre></div>
<p>This code will cause your program to throw an exception when dividing a double by 0 just
 as it automatically did when dividing an int by 0.</p>

<p>You actually create an instance of an ArithmeticException object as the following code demonstrates:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
if(divisor == 0)
{
   ArithmeticException myException = new ArithmeticException();
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>throw myException;</pre></div>
}
</pre></div>

<p>The constructor for each exception is overloaded to take a string. This allows you to provide information
  about the exception that can be displayed later.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
if(divisor == 0)
{
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>throw</pre></div> new ArithmeticException(
        "Tried to divide " + dividend + " by zero!");
}
</pre></div>

<p>You can display this message by calling the method getMessage on the exception object when you catch it. 
For example, you might modify the message dialog to show the string you passed to the exception constructor:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void divide()
{
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>try</pre></div>
   {
       if(divisor == 0)
       {
         <div id="csHighlight"><pre>throw</pre></div> new ArithmeticException(
                "Tried to divide " + dividend + " by zero!");
       }
       quotient = dividend / divisor;
   }    
   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>catch</pre></div>(ArithmeticException e)
   {
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   } 
}
</pre></div>
<p>You can now see why it is called throwing and catching an exception.</p>
