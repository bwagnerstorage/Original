<p>Consider a software system that models a horse barn. Classes that represent horses implement the following interface.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public interface Horse
{
   /** 
    @return the horse's name 
    */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>String getName();</pre></div>
   
   /** 
    @return the horse's weight 
    */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>int getWeight();</pre></div>
        
   // There may be methods that are not shown.
}
</pre></div>
<p>A horse barn consists of N numbered spaces. Each space can hold at most 
        one horse. The spaces are indexed
        starting from 0; the index of the last space is N &#8211; 1. No two horses 
        in the barn have the same name.
        The declaration of the HorseBarn class is shown below. You will write 
        two unrelated methods of the
        HorseBarn class.</p>
 
<div id="apCode"><pre>       
public class HorseBarn
{
   /** The spaces in the barn. Each array element holds a 
     * reference to the horse that is currently occupying 
     * the space. A null value indicates an empty space.
     */
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private Horse[] spaces;</pre></div>
        
    /** Returns the index of the space that contains the horse
      *   with the specified name.
      * <strong>Precondition</strong>: No two horses in the barn have the same name
      * @param name the name of the horse to find
      * @return the index of the space containing

    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public int findHorseSpace(String name)</pre></div>
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }
       
    /** Consolidates the barn by moving horses so that the 
      * horses are in adjacent spaces, starting at index 0,
      * with no empty space between any two horses.
      * <strong>Postcondition</strong>: The order of the horses is the same as before
      *   the consolidation.
      */
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public void consolidate()</pre></div>
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }
        
    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods
    // that are not shown.
}

<div id="csList2">
   <ol>
        <li><p>Write the HorseBarn method findHorseSpace. This method returns the index of the space in
          which the horse with the specified name is located. If there is no horse 
          with the specified name in the barn,
          the method returns -1.</p>
          
          <p>For example, assume a HorseBarn object called sweetHome has horses in 
          the following spaces. </p>

<li><p>Write the HorseBarn method consolidate. This method consolidates the barn by moving horses so
    that the horses are in adjacent spaces, starting at index 0, with no 
    empty spaces between any two horses.</p>
    <p>After the barn is consolidated, the horses are in the same order as 
    they were before the consolidation.</p>
    <p>For example, assume a barn has horses in the following spaces.</p>
