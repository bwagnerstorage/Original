      <p>A mountain climbing club maintains a record of the climbs that its members 
        have made. Information about a
        climb includes the name of the mountain peak and the amount of time it 
        took to reach the top. The information is
        contained in the <strong>ClimbInfo</strong> class as declared below.</p>
      <div id="apCode"><pre>
public class ClimbInfo
{
   /** Creates a ClimbInfo object with name peakName and time climbTime.
     * @param peakName the name of the mountain peak
     * @param climbTime the number of minutes taken to complete the climb
     */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public ClimbInfo(String peakName, int climbTime)</pre></div>
   { /* implementation not shown */ } 

   /** @return the name of the mountain peak
     */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public String getName()</pre></div>

   { /* implementation not shown */ }
      
   // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that 
   //   are not shown.
}
</pre></div>
      <p>The ClimbingClub class maintains a list of the climbs made by members 
        of the club. The declaration of the <strong>ClimbingClub</strong> class is shown below. </p>
	  <p>You will write two different implementations of the addClimb
        method.</p>

     *   list of climbs.

           the order they were added */

<div id="csList2">

        <li> 
          <p>Write an implementation of the ClimbingClub method addClimb that 
            stores the ClimbInfo objects in the order they were added. This implementation of addClimb 
            should create a new ClimbInfo object with the given name and time. It appends a reference 
            to that object to the end of climbList. For example, consider the following code segment.
            
			<div id="apCode"><pre>
ClimbingClub hikerClub = new ClimbingClub();
hikerClub.addClimb(&quot;Monadnock&quot;, 274);
hikerClub.addClimb(&quot;Whiteface&quot;, 301);

hikerClub.addClimb(&quot;Monadnock&quot;, 344);

          that stores the elements of climbList in alphabetical order by name (as determined by the compareTo 
          method of the String class). This implementation of addClimb should create a new ClimbInfo 
          object with the given name and time and then insert the object into the appropriate position in 
          climbList. Entries that have the same name will be grouped together and can appear in any order within 
          the group.</p>
