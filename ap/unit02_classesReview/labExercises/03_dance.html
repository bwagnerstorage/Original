<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>The student council at your school is sponsoring a dance and they have asked you to write a program
   to help them track the number of students entering the dance and how much money is made off of 
   ticket sales. The council has decided to sell tickets to the dance according to the Renaissance
   incentives program. (Renaissance is the school's rewards program that offers discounts to school
   functions for students who make good grades.)</p>
<p>Ticket prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Renaissance Level Ticket Price</p> 
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Gold - Free</li> 
<li>Silver - 2.00</li> 
<li>Bronze - 4.00</li> 
<li>No Pass - 6.00</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A student holding a gold card is admitted into the dance at no charge. A student holding a silver
  card is charged 2.00 dollars, a student holding a bronze card is charged 4.00 dollars, and a 
  student without a Renaissance card is charged 6.00 dollars.</p>
