<p>The recursive methods we have looked at so far have all been non-void methods with a return value:</p>

<div id="csList">
   public <strong>int </strong>factorial(int n)<br>
   public <strong>int</strong> countDown(int n)
</div>
<p>However, this is not a requirement when implementing a recursive method. A recursive method can be a void. Look at the code segment below.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void song(int b)
{
   if( // base case has been reached )
      return;
   else
      song(b-1);   // recursive case
}
</pre></div>
<p>One approach used to exit a void method is to use a <strong>return</strong> statement with nothing after it.
      Notice that the call to recursive case is made on a line that does not contain a return.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, if we were on a long trip somewhere we would occasionally sing the
    song "Bottles of Beer on the Wall". This old song is a perfect example of a recursive process. 
	In this assignment you are going to implement a recursive method that writes out the words to 
	this song. Since you are all under the drinking age, we will modify the song a little bit by 
	making the bottles "root beer" instead of "beer". If you don't know the song refer to the Sample Run below.</p>

<p>Copy the following code into a file named SongApp.java</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SongApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SongTester s = new SongTester();
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
            
        System.out.print("Enter number of bottles -->");
        int b = keyboard.nextInt();
        s.song(b);    // call to void method
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println();
    }
}

class SongTester
{
    public void song(int b)
    {

    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Implement the song method declared above using recursion.</p>
