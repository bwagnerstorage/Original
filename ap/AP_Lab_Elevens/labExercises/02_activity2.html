<h1>Initial Design of a Deck Class</h1>
<p>Think about a deck of cards. How would you describe a deck of cards? When you play card games,
what kinds of operations do these games require a deck to provide?</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Now consider implementing a class to represent a deck of cards. Describe its instance variables and
methods, and discuss your design with a classmate.</p>
<p>Read the partial implementation of the Deck class.
This file contains the instance variables, constructor header, and method headers for a Deck class
general enough to be useful for a variety of card games. Discuss the Deck class with your classmates;
in particular, make sure you understand the role of each of the parameters to the Deck constructor,
and of each of the private instance variables in the Deck class.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Complete the implementation of the Deck class by coding each of the following:</p>
<div id="csList2"><ol>
<li><p><strong>Deck constructor</strong> - This constructor receives three arrays as parameters. The arrays contain
the ranks, suits, and point values for each card in the deck. The constructor creates an
ArrayList, and then creates the specified cards and adds them to the list.</p>
<p>For example, if ranks = {"A", "B", "C"}, suits = {"Giraffes", "Lions"},
and values = {2,1,6}, the constructor would create the following cards:</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
["A", "Giraffes", 2], ["B", "Giraffes", 1], ["C", "Giraffes", 6],
["A", "Lions", 2], ["B", "Lions", 1], ["C", "Lions", 6]
</pre></div>
<p>and would add each of them to cards. The parameter size would then be set to the size of
cards, which in this example is 6.</p>
<p>Finally, the constructor should shuffle the deck by calling the shuffle method. Note that you
will not be implementing the shuffle method until Activity 4.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>isEmpty</strong> - This method should return true when the size of the deck is 0; false
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>size</strong> - This method returns the number of cards in the deck that are left to be dealt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>deal</strong> - This method "deals" a card by removing a card from the deck and returning it, if there
are any cards in the deck left to be dealt. It returns null if the deck is empty. There are several
ways of accomplishing this task. Here are two possible algorithms:</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm 1</strong>: Because the cards are being held in an ArrayList, it would be easy to simply
call the List method that removes an object at a specified index, and return that object.
Removing the object from the end of the list would be more efficient than removing it from the
beginning of the list. Note that the use of this algorithm also requires a separate "discard" list to
keep track of the dealt cards. This is necessary so that the dealt cards can be reshuffled and dealt
again.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm 2</strong>: It would be more efficient to leave the cards in the list. Instead of removing the
card, simply decrement the size instance variable and then return the card at size. In this
algorithm, the size instance variable does double duty; it determines which card to "deal" and
it also represents how many cards in the deck are left to be dealt. This is the algorithm that you
should implement.</p>
</li></ol></div></li>
<li><p>Once you have completed the Deck class, open the DeckTester.java file. Add code in the main method to create three Deck objects and test each method for
each Deck object.
</p></li>
</ol></div>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>: Answer questions on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2,...,10 are 2,...,10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
</pre></div>
<p>initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter?</p></li>
</ol></div>
