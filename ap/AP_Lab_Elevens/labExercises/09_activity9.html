<h1>Implementing the Elevens Board</h1>
<p>In Activity 8, we <strong>refactored</strong> (reorganized) the original ElevensBoard class into a new Board class
and a much smaller ElevensBoard class. The purpose of this change was to allow code reuse in new
games such as Tens and Thirteens. Now you will complete the implementation of the methods in the
refactored ElevensBoard class.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Complete the <strong>ElevensBoard</strong> class, implementing the following methods.</p>

<div id="csList2"><ol>
<h3>Abstract methods from the Board class:</h3>
<li><p><strong>isLegal</strong> - This method is described in the method heading and related comments below.
The implementation should check the number of cards selected and utilize the ElevensBoard
helper methods.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**
* Determines if the selected cards form a valid group for removal.
* In Elevens, the legal groups are (1) a pair of non-face cards
* whose values add to 11, and (2) a group of three cards consisting of
* <div id="apHighlight"><pre>a jack, a queen, and a king</pre></div> in some order.
* @param selectedCards the list of the indexes of the selected cards.
* @return true if the selected cards form a valid group for removal;
* false otherwise.
*/
@Override
public boolean isLegal(List<Integer> selectedCards)


</pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>anotherPlayIsPossible</strong> - This method should also utilize the helper methods. It
should be very short.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**
* Determine if there are any legal plays left on the board.
* In Elevens, there is a legal play if the board contains
* (1) a pair of non-face cards whose values add to 11, or (2) a group
* of three cards consisting of <div id="apHighlight"><pre>a jack, a queen, and a king</pre></div> in some order.
* @return true if there is a legal play left on the board;
*    false otherwise.
*/
@Override
public boolean anotherPlayIsPossible()


</pre></div></li>
<h3>ElevensBoard helper methods:</h3>
<li><p><strong>containsPairSum11</strong> - This method determines if the selected elements of cards
contain a pair of cards whose point values add to 11.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**
* Check for an 11-pair in the selected cards.
* @param selectedCards selects a subset of this board. It is this list
*    of indexes into this board that are searched
*    to find an 11-pair.
* @return true if the board entries indexed in selectedCards
*    contain an 11-pair; false otherwise.
*/
private boolean containsPairSum11(List&lt;Integer&gt; selectedCards)


</pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>containsJQK</strong> - This method determines if the selected elements of cards contains a
jack, a queen, and a king in some order.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**
* Check for a JQK in the selected cards.
* @param selectedCards selects a subset of this board. It is this list
*    of indexes into this board that are searched
*    to find a JQK-triplet.
* @return true if the board entries indexed in selectedCards
*    include a jack, a queen, and a king; false otherwise.
*/
private boolean containsJQK(List&lt;Integer&gt; selectedCards)


</pre></div></li>

</ol></div></li></ol></div>

<p>When you have completed these methods, run the <strong>main</strong> method found in
ElevensGUIRunner.java. Make sure that the Elevens game works correctly.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>The size of the board is one of the differences between Elevens and Thirteens. Why is size not an
abstract method?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are there no abstract methods dealing with the selection of the cards to be removed or replaced
in the array cards?</p></li>
<li><p>Another way to create "IS-A" relationships is by implementing interfaces. Suppose that instead of
creating an abstract Board class, we created the following Board interface, and had
ElevensBoard implement it. Would this new scheme allow the Elevens GUI to call isLegal
and anotherPlayIsPossible polymorphically? Would this alternate design work as well as
the abstract Board class design? Why or why not?</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public interface Board
{
   boolean isLegal(List&lt;Integer&gt; selectedCards);
   boolean anotherPlayIsPossible();
}
</pre></div></li>
</ol></div>
