<h1>Simulation of Elevens</h1>
<p>We have implemented two different solitaire games that we can play, Elevens and Thirteens. That is
perfect if we want to entertain ourselves playing them. But what if we want to answer questions about the
games? For example, what percentage of Elevens games can be won? You probably already have some idea
about the answer to this question, but you might have to play thousands of games to have any real
confidence in your answer. That's where simulation comes in.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>A common computing application is the <strong>simulation</strong> of some process; in other words, writing a program
that imitates the process in some way. The behaviors and state in the program represent key features of,
and are said to provide a model for, the process. An example is a simulation of a household robot vacuum
cleaner. Internally, the simulation program is keeping track of its environment, the battery level, and the
amount of dust in its dust container, and is perhaps displaying them on a computer console. Program
methods plot the robot's course through rooms in the "house" and determine when it is finished.</p>

<p>A simulation is useful when the process being simulated is too complicated, too slow, too dangerous, or
too expensive to observe in the real world. Also, understanding the program helps one understand the
process being simulated. For example, the producers of the robot vacuum cleaner would have used a
simulation to debug its algorithms before starting to manufacture the actual robots.</p>

<p>A program is called <strong>probabilistic</strong> when its state change is affected by chance. One example is a traffic
simulation, which has to account for cars unpredictably entering the traffic zone and driving at varying
speeds. A more obvious example is a simulation of a game based on dice or spinners. In Elevens, the
probabilistic element is the shuffling of the deck of cards.</p>

<p>To model random events, we use a <strong>pseudo-random number</strong> generator (the "pseudo" is usually omitted).
In the Deck shuffle method, we used the Math.random method to generate our random
numbers. This reliance on chance significantly complicates the task of verifying that a simulation is
behaving correctly. The programmer needs to have a good idea of what output to expect. Also, a small
number of outcomes of the chance events may produce misleading behavior. For example, four flips of a
coin may produce all heads, but it would be a mistake to assume that this behavior would happen often.
Ten thousand flips would produce the more reasonable outcome of around 50 percent heads and
50 percent tails. The typical probabilistic simulation involves a large number of calls to the random
number generator to increase the likelihood that the output reflects expected behavior.</p>

<p>To simulate Elevens, we will need to model the "playing" of the game using program state and behavior.
Let's see how the real world relates to the code:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/Elevens5.png"></div>

<p>We have most of this code already written. We have already taken care of all the state requirements.
The deck of cards is modeled by the cards list in the Deck class. And the cards on the board are
represented by the cards array in the Board class. We have also written methods for most of the
necessary behaviors. In fact, we only need to model the additional things you do when you are playing the
game yourself!</p>
<p>In the exercises, you will use an ElevensSimulation class, which will play games of Elevens. It will
need access to methods that mimic the actions you make when you play the game. What do you do when
you play the game and why do you do it? Answer these questions:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>What do you do repeatedly to play a game?</p></li>
<li><p>As you are scanning the cards on the board, what are you trying to find?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you decide to click on a group of cards?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when you click the Replace button?</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>We will model these behaviors with three new methods in the ElevensBoard class:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p><strong>playIfPossible</strong> - Looks for a legal play and makes the play (if found). This is the only
new method that ElevensSimulation needs to call directly. We could put all of our new
code into this method, but it's helpful to divide it up using two new private helper methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>playPairSum11IfPossible</strong> - Looks for an 11-pair and replaces it (if found).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>playJQKIfPossible</strong> - Looks for a JQK-triplet and replaces it (if found).</p></li>
</ul></div>

<p>Next we consider the implementation of playPairSum11IfPossible. This method needs to first
determine if the board contains an 11-pair. Then, if it finds one, it needs to remove it. Of course,
playPairSum11IfPossible could call containsPairSum11 to see if there is an 11-pair on
the board. But containsPairSum11 doesn't return any information about the indexes of the two
cards that make up the 11-pair. So, playPairSum11IfPossible would have to find the pair again
before removing it. To avoid having to find the pair twice, we would need to copy the code from
containsPairSum11 into playPairSum11IfPossible. Thankfully, there's a better way.</p>

<p>What if we change the containsPairSum11 method into a findPairSum11 method? In other
words, instead of having a "contains" method that returns a boolean value, we have a "find" method
that returns a list of the indexes of the two cards in the pair. If there is no 11-pair on the board, it will
return an empty list. Now, playPairSum11IfPossible will be able to call findPairSum11,
and if there is an 11-pair, it will already have the list of indexes needed to call the
replaceSelectedCards method. This design eliminates both the duplicated code and the double
work! We will need to make a similar modification to change the containsJQK method into a
findJQK method for the playJQKIfPossible method to call.</p>

<p>Note that it's usually not possible to foresee everything during the initial design of a program. For
example, in the GUI version of Elevens, there was no need for "find" methods. The person playing the
game had that task. However, the "find" methods became useful when we got into the details of the
simulation. So, program designs can and do change.</p>

<p>Of course, when we do an initial program design, we try to accommodate all the needs of the problem as
we understand them. But we also try to keep the design flexible, so that we can accommodate future
needs. One rule of program design is that methods should be private, unless there is a good reason
for another class to call those methods. Because we initially made containsPairSum11 private,
we know that no other class uses it. Therefore, it's safe to rename and change it.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>First, examine the completed ElevensSimulation class in the Activity11 Project.
This simulation creates an ElevensBoard object, and uses it to play GAMES_TO_PLAY games
of Elevens. Note that the only new ElevensBoard method used is <strong>playIfPossible</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now make the necessary changes to the ElevensBoard class. Change <strong>containsPairSum11</strong>
into <strong>findPairSum11</strong>. You will need to change both the method heading and the method body.
Note that the method's comment block has already been changed for you.
Change the <strong>isLegal</strong> and <strong>anotherPlayIsPossible</strong> methods to use <strong>findPairSum11</strong>
instead of <strong>containsPairSum11</strong>. Note that the board contains an 11-pair if and only if
findPairSum11(cIndexes).size() > 0 .</p></li>
<li><p>Change <strong>containsJQK</strong> to <strong>findJQK</strong> in a similar fashion to the <strong>containsPairSum11</strong> to
<strong>findPairSum11</strong> conversion you did in exercise 2 above. Again, the method's comment block has
already been changed for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>isLegal</strong> and <strong>anotherPlayIsPossible</strong> methods to use <strong>findJQK</strong> instead of
<strong>containsJQK</strong>. At this point, the Elevens GUI program should work just as it did before.</p></li>
<li><p>It's time to complete the ElevensBoard methods required by the ElevensSimulation
class. First complete the public <strong>playIfPossible</strong> method, which is called from the
ElevensSimulation class. This method will use the private
<strong>playPairSum11IfPossible</strong> and <strong>playJQKIfPossible</strong> helper methods. Note that you
will have to replace the return statement in the stubbed out method.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the private <strong>playPairSum11IfPossible</strong> and <strong>playJQKIfPossible</strong> helper
methods. Note that you will have to replace the return statements in the stubbed out methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Now it's time to test your simulation-related changes. Make sure that GAMES_TO_PLAY and
I_AM_DEBUGGING are initialized to 1 and true respectively in ElevensSimulation.
Also make sure that I_AM_DEBUGGING is initialized to true in ElevensBoard. Run the
ElevensSimulation program a few times and examine the output. You should be able to see
both 11-pairs and JQK-triplets being correctly identified and removed.</p></li>
