<h1>Playing Elevens</h1>
<p>In this activity, the game Elevens will be explained, and you will play an interactive version of the game.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>The solitaire game of Elevens uses a deck of 52 cards, with ranks A (ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack),
Q (queen), and K (king), and suits clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. Here is how it
is played.</p>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>The deck is shuffled, and nine cards are dealt "face up" from the deck to the board.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the following sequence of steps is repeated:</p>
<div id="csList2"><ol>
<li><p>The player removes each pair of cards (A, 2, ... , 10) that total 11, e.g., an 8 and a 3, or a 10
and an A. An ace is worth 1, and suits are ignored when determining cards to remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Any triplet consisting of a J, a Q, and a K is also removed by the player. Suits are also ignored
when determining which cards to remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Cards are dealt from the deck if possible to replace the cards just removed.</p></li>
</ol></div></li></ol></div>
<p>The game is won when the deck is empty and no cards remain on the table. Here's a sample game, in
which underlined cards are replacements from the deck.</p>

<p>An interactive GUI version of Elevens allows one to play by clicking card images and buttons rather than
by handling actual cards. When Elevens.jar is run, the cards on the board are displayed in a window.
Clicking on an unselected card selects it; clicking on a selected card unselects it. Clicking on the Replace
button first checks that the selection is legal; if so, it does the removal and deals cards to fill the empty
slots. Clicking on the Restart button restarts the game.</p>
<h1>Exercise</h1>
