<h1>Shuffling the Cards in a Deck</h1>
<p>Think about how you shuffle a deck of cards by hand. How well do you think it randomizes the cards in
the deck?</p>
<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>
We now consider the shuffling of a deck, that is, the permutation of its cards into a random-looking
sequence. A requirement of the shuffling procedure is that any particular permutation has just as much
chance of occurring as any other. We will be using the Math.random method to generate random
numbers to produce these permutations.</p>
<p>Several ideas for designing a shuffling method come to mind. We will consider two:</p>

<h3>Perfect Shuffle</h3>
<p>Card players often shuffle by splitting the deck in half and then interleaving the two half-decks, as shown
below.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/Elevens2.png"></div>

<p>This procedure is called a <strong>perfect shuffle</strong> if the interleaving alternates between the two half-decks.
Unfortunately, the perfect shuffle comes nowhere near generating all possible deck permutations.
In fact, eight shuffles of a 52-card deck return the deck to its original state!</p>

<p>Consider the following "perfect shuffle" algorithm that starts with an array named cards that contains
52 cards and creates an array named shuffled.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
Initialize shuffled to contain 52 "empty" elements.
Set k to 0.
For j = 0 to 25,
   - Copy cards[j] to shuffled[k];
   - Set k to k+2.
Set k to 1.
For j = 26 to 51,
   - Copy cards[j] to shuffled[k];
   - Set k to k+2.
</pre></div>

<p>This approach moves the first half of cards to the even index positions of shuffled, and it moves
the second half of cards to the odd index positions of shuffled.</p>
<p>The above algorithm shuffles 52 cards. If an odd number of cards is shuffled, the array shuffled has
one more even-indexed position than odd-indexed positions. Therefore, the first loop must copy one
more card than the second loop does. This requires rounding up when calculating the index of the middle
of the deck. In other words, in the first loop j must go up to (cards.length + 1) / 2,
exclusive, and in the second loop j must begin at (cards.length + 1) / 2.</p>

<h3>Selection Shuffle</h3>
<p>Consider the following algorithm that starts with an array named cards that contains 52 cards and
creates an array named shuffled. We will call this algorithm the "<strong>selection shuffle</strong>."</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
Initialize shuffled to contain 52 "empty" elements.
Then for k = 0 to 51,
   - Repeatedly generate a random integer j between 0 and 51, inclusive until
     cards[j] contains a card (not marked as empty);
   - Copy cards[j] to shuffled[k];
   - Set cards[j] to empty.
</pre></div>

<p>This approach finds a suitable card for the kth position of the deck. Unsuitable candidates are any cards
that have already been placed in the deck.</p>
<p>While this is a more promising approach than the perfect shuffle, its big defect is that it runs too slowly.
Every time an empty element is selected, it has to loop again. To determine the last element of
shuffled requires an average of 52 calls to the random number generator.</p>

<p>A better version, the "<strong>efficient selection shuffle</strong>," works as follows:</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
For k = 51 down to 1,
   - Generate a random integer r between 0 and k, inclusive;
   - Exchange cards[k] and cards[r].
</pre></div>

<p>This has the same structure as <strong>selection sort</strong>:</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
For k = 51 down to 1,
   - Find r, the position of the largest value among cards[0] through cards[k];
   - Exchange cards[k] and cards[r].
</pre></div>
<p>The selection shuffle algorithm does not require to a loop to find the largest (or smallest) value to swap, so
it works quickly.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Use the file Shuffler.java to implement the <strong>perfect
shuffle</strong> and the <strong>efficient selection shuffle</strong> methods as described in the Exploration section of this
activity. You will be shuffling arrays of integers.</p></li>
<li><p>Shuffler.java also provides a main method that calls the shuffling methods. Execute the
main method and inspect the output to see how well each shuffle method actually randomizes the
array elements. You should execute main with different values of SHUFFLE_COUNT and
VALUE_COUNT.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<h1>Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>: Answer questions on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Write a static method named <strong>flip</strong> that simulates a flip of a weighted coin by returning either
"heads" or "tails" each time it is called. The coin is twice as likely to turn up heads as tails.
Thus, flip should return "heads" about twice as often as it returns "tails."</p></li>
<li><p>Write a static method named <strong>arePermutations</strong> that, given two int arrays of the same length
but with no duplicate elements, returns true if one array is a permutation of the other (i.e., the
arrays differ only in how their contents are arranged). Otherwise, it should return false.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the initial contents of the values array in Shuffler.java are {1, 2, 3, 4}. 
   For what sequence of random integers would the efficient selection shuffle change values to
contain {4, 3, 2, 1}?</p></li>
