<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>A company hires its employees as either hourly or salary workers. A set of classes is used to handle the
   different types of employees at the company. The class hierarchy is shown in the following diagram.</p>
   
   <div align="center"><img src="images/employee.gif"></div>

<p>The class <strong>Employee</strong> is specified as an abstract class as shown in the following declaration.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public abstract class Employee
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;
    private String ssNum;
    
    // constructor
    public Employee(String n, String s)
    {
       name = n;
       ssNum = s;   
    }
    
    public String getName()
    {
      return name;  
    }
    
    public String getSSNum()
    {
      return ssNum; 
    }
    
    // returns an employee's monthly salary
    public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>abstract</pre></div> double getSalary();
    
}
</pre></div>
<p>Each employee has a name and social secuirty number. Two additional classes are used to represent the two 
  types of employees and are described in the table below.</p>

<table width = "75%" id="csTable">
        <tr bgcolor="#000099"> 
          <th width="20%"> <div align="center" width="40%">Class</div></th>
          <th width="80%"> <div align="center" width="60%">Description</div></th>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><div align="center"><strong>Hourly</strong></div></td>
          <td>Hourly employees are paid by the hour. The monthly salary is calculated 
            by multiplying the number of hours worked each month by the hourly 
            rate. Hourly workers are also paid time and a half for any work done 
            beyond 160 hours a month (40 hours x 4 weeks).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><div align="center"><strong>Salary</strong></div></td>
          <td>Salary employees are paid a yearly salary. The monthly salary is 
            calculated by dividing the yearly salary by 12 (12 months). Salary 
            employees are not paid overtime.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<h1>Modifications</h1>

<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li><h3>Salary Class</h3>
<p>Write the complete class declaration for the class Salary. Include all necessary instance variables
   and implementations of its constructor and method(s). The constructor should take three parameters that
   indicate the employee's name, social security number, and yearly salary. Implement the method getSalary
   so that it calculates and returns the monthly salary as described above.</p>

</li>
<li><h3>Hourly Class</h3>
<p>Write the complete class declaration for the class Hourly. Include all necessary instance variables
   and implementations of its constructor and method(s). The constructor should take four parameters that
   indicate the employee's name, social security number, hourly wage, and hours worked for month. Implement 
   the method getSalary so that it calculates and returns the monthly salary as described above.</p>
</li></ol></div>
