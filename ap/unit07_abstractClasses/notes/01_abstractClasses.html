<h1>Abstract Classes</h1>
<p>An <strong>abstract class</strong> is a kind of ghost class. It can pass along methods and variables but it can't ever be
   instantiated itself. That is, we can never create an object of an abstract class.</p>

<p>A class is declared abstract by including the abstract modifier in the class header. Any class that contains one or more
   abstract methods must be declared as abstract. In abstract classes the abstract modifier must be applied to each abstract
   method. A class declared as abstract does not have to contain abstract methods.</p>
   
<div id="csCode" style="width:400px">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>abstract</pre></div> class MyClass
{

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The purpose of abstract classes is to act as placeholders in a class hierarchy. For example, an abstract class may contain a partial
  description that is inherited by all of its descendants in the class hierarchy. Its children, which are more specific,
  fill the gaps.</p>

<p>Consider the class hierachy shown below.</p><br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/vehicle.gif"></div><br>

<p>The <strong>Vehicle</strong> class at the top of the hierarchy may be too general to be used by the application,
   so we implement it as an <strong>abstract</strong> class. Still, general ideas that apply to all vehicles can be represented
   in the Vehicle class and are inherited by its child classes. That way, each of its child classes doesn't have to define the
   same idea. For example, we may say that all vehicles have a particular speed. Therefore we declare a speed variable in the
   Vehicle class, and all the cars and boats and planes automatically have that variable because of inheritance. Any change
   we make to the speed in the abstract class Vehicle automatically show up in all the child classes. Or we may declare an
   abstract method called fuelConsumption, which we're going to use to calculate mileage. The details of the fuelConsumption
   method will be different for each type of vehicle, but the Vehicle class establishes that all vehicles consume fuel and
   it gives us a consistent way to calculate mileage.</p>

<p>Some things don't apply to all vehicles, so we wouldn't represent them at the Vehicle level. For instance, we wouldn't
   include a variable called numberOfWheels in the Vehicle class, because boats don't have wheels. The child classes that have
   wheels can add that at the appropriate level in the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Usually, a child of an abstract class will have a specific definition for an abstract method inherited from its parent.
   Note that this is just a case of <strong>overriding</strong> a method, giving a different definition that the one the parent
   provides. If a child of an abstract class does not give a definition for every abstract method that it inherits from its
   parent, the child class is also considered abstract.</p>
 
<h1>Example</h1>

<p>This example contains three classes. The diagram below showns the class hierachy.</p>
   <br><div align="center"><img src="images/pet.gif"></div><br>
<p>The <strong>Pet</strong> class is at the top of the hierarchy and it is declared abstract. The <strong>Dog</strong> and <strong>Snake</strong> classes are derived from the Pet class.</p>
<p>Pet contains two abstract methods named <strong>speak</strong> and <strong>move</strong>. Since all pets can speak and move, but in
   different ways. It does not make sense to implement these methods in the Pet class. Instead deferring the implementation to
   subclasses allows them to be given meaning that is specific to the type of pet.</p>

<h3>Pet Class</h3>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>abstract</pre></div> class Pet
{
    private String name;
    
    public Pet(String petName)
    {
        name = petName;
    }
    
    public String getName()
    {
        return name;
    }
    
    public String toString()
    {
        return "pet " + name;
    }
    
    ///////////////////////////////
    //      abstract methods     //
    ///////////////////////////////
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>abstract</pre></div> public String speak();
    
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>abstract</pre></div> public String move();   
}
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Dog Class</h3>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Dog extends Pet
{
    private int weight;
    
    public Dog(String dogName, int dogWeight)
    {
        super(dogName);      // call superclass's constructor to initialize name
        weight = dogWeight;
    }
    
    public int getWeight()
    {
        return weight;
    }
    
    public String toString()
    {
        return super.toString() + " is a dog, weighing " + weight + " pounds";
    }
    
    public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>speak</pre></div>()
    {
        return "woof";
    }
    
    public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>move</pre></div>()
    {
        return "run";
    }   
}
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Snake Class</h3>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Snake extends Pet
{
   private int length;
	
   public Snake(String snakeName, int snakeLength)
   {
      super(snakeName);     // call superclass's constructor to initialize name
      length = snakeLength;
   }

   public int getLength()
   {
      return length;
   }
	
   public String toString()
   {
      return super.toString() + " is a snake, " + length + " inches long";
   }
	
   public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>speak</pre></div>()
   {
      return "hiss";
   }
	
   public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>move</pre></div>()
   {
      return "slither";
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Client Code</h3>
<p>Here is a class named MyPets that tests the functionality of these three classes.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class MyPets
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Pet maddie = new Dog("Maddie", 45);
        Pet sam = new Snake("Sam", 30);
        
        System.out.println(maddie);
        System.out.println(maddie.getName() + " says " + maddie.speak());
        System.out.println(maddie.move() + " " + maddie.getName() + " " + maddie.move());
        System.out.println(((Dog)maddie).getWeight());
        
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println(sam);
        System.out.println(sam.getName() + " says " + sam.speak());
        System.out.println(sam.move() + " " + sam.getName() + " " + sam.move());
        System.out.println(((Snake)sam).getLength());
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Output</h3>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
pet Maddie is a dog, weighing 45 pounds
Maddie says woof
run Maddie run

pet Sam is a snake, 30 inches long
Sam says hiss
slither Sam slither
</pre>
</div><br>
<H1>Polymorphism</H1>
<p>Abstract classes can also utilize polymorphism. Look at the code that instantiates a new Dog and Snake object.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:550px">
<pre>
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>Pet</pre></div> maddie = new Dog("Maddie", 45);
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>Pet</pre></div> sam = new Snake("Sam", 30);
</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice the two objects are stored in Pet variables. A Pet variable can store either a dog or a snake. This is polymorphism.</p>
<p>Since methods getName, speak, and move were declared in the Pet class a cast is not needed inorder to 
   call them.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
System.out.println(maddie.getName() + " says " + maddie.speak());
System.out.println(maddie.move() + " " + maddie.getName() + " " + maddie.move());
</pre>
</div>
<p>However, the methods getWeight and getLength are defined specificly in the Dog and Snake classes, therefore a cast is required
   in order to call these methods using a Pet variable.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:550px">
<pre>
System.out.println((<div id="csHighlight"><pre>(Dog)</pre></div>maddie).getWeight());
System.out.println((<div id="csHighlight"><pre>(Snake)</pre></div>sam).getLength());
</pre>
</div>
<p>Of course the variable maddie must actually contain a Dog object in order to perform a cast to a dog.</p>
<p>Also if maddie was declared using a Dog variable(no polymorphism) then a cast would not be necessary.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
<div id="csHighlight"><pre>Dog</pre></div> maddie = new Dog("Maddie", 45);
System.out.println(maddie.getName() + " says " + maddie.speak());
System.out.println(maddie.move() + " " + maddie.getName() + " " + maddie.move());
System.out.println(maddie.getWeight()); <div id="csHighlight"><pre> // cast not needed</pre></div>
</pre>
</div>
