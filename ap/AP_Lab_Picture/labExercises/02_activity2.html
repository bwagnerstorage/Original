<p>When you click the OK button, the red, green, and blue values for the color you picked will be displayed
as shown below. The Color class has a toString method that displays the class name followed by
the red, green, and blue values. The toString method is automatically called when you print an
object.</p>

<p>Java represents color using the java.awt.Color class. This is the full name for the Color class,
which includes the package name of java.awt followed by a period and then the class name
Color. Java groups related classes into packages. The awt stands for Abstract Windowing Toolkit,
which is the package that contains the original Graphical User Interface (GUI) classes developed for
Java. You can use just the short name for a class, like Color, as long as you include an import
statement at the beginning of a class source file, as shown below. The Picture class contains the
following import statement.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
import java.awt.Color;
</pre></div>
