<h1>Introduction to Digital Pictures and Color</h1>

<p>If you look at an advertisement for a digital camera, it will tell you how many megapixels the camera
can record. What is a megapixel? A digital camera has sensors that record color at millions of points
arranged in rows and columns (Figure 1). Each point is a pixel or picture (abbreviated pix) element.
A megapixel is one million pixels. A 16.2 megapixel camera can store the color at over 16 million pixels.
That's a lot of pixels! Do you really need all of them? If you are sending a small version of your picture
to a friend's phone, then just a few megapixels will be plenty. But, if you are printing a huge poster from
a picture or you want to zoom in on part of the picture, then more pixels will give you more detail.</p>

<p>How is the color of a pixel recorded? It can be represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color
model, which stores values for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. You can make yellow
by combining red and green. That probably sounds strange, but combining pixels isn't the same as
mixing paint to make a color. The computer uses light to display color, not paint. Tilt the bottom of a
CD in white light and you will see lots of colors. The CD acts as a prism and lets you see all the colors in
white light. The RGB color model sometimes also stores an alpha value as well as the red, green, and blue
values. The alpha value indicates how transparent or opaque the color is. A color that is transparent will
let you see some of the color beneath it.</p>

<p>How does the computer represent the values from 0 to 255? A decimal number uses the digits 0 to 9 and
powers of 10 to represent values. The decimal number 325 means 5 ones (10<sup>0</sup>) plus 2 tens (10<sup>1</sup>) plus
3 hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>) for a total of three hundred and twenty-five. Computers use binary numbers, which use
the digits 0 and 1 and powers of 2 to represent values using groups of bits. A bit is a binary digit, which
can be either 0 or 1. A group of 8 bits is called a byte. The binary number 110 means 0 ones (2<sup>0</sup>) plus
1 two (2<sup>1</sup>) plus 1 four (2<sup>2</sup>), for a total of 6.</p>
