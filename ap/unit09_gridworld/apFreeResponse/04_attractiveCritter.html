<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves reasoning about the GridWorld case study. Reference materials are provided in the
Appendix.</p>
<p>An attractive critter is a critter that processes other actors by attempting to relocate all of the other actors in the
grid, including other attractive critters. The attractive critter attempts to move each other actor one grid cell
closer to itself in the direction specified by <strong>getDirectionToward</strong>. An actor is relocated only if the
location into which it would be relocated is empty. If an actor cannot be moved, it is left in its original position.
After trying to move all other actors, the attractive critter moves like a critter.</p>
<p>The following series of figures represents an example of how the attractive critter affects the other actors in
the grid.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/AttractiveCritter1.png"></div>

<p>The order in which the actors in the grid are processed is not specified, making it possible to get different results
from the same grid of actors.</p>

<p>Write the complete <strong>AttractiveCritter</strong> class, including all instance variables and required methods. Do
NOT override the act method. Remember that your design must not violate the postconditions of the methods
of the Critter class and that updating an object's instance variable changes the state of that object.</p>
