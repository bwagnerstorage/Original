<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves reasoning about the GridWorld case study. Reference materials are provided in the
Appendix.</p>

<p>In this question, you will write two unrelated methods of the GridChecker class that will process a
BoundedGrid&ltActor&gt object. Recall that the BoundedGrid class implements the Grid interface.
Also note that the methods in the Grid interface that return an array list will return an empty array list when
no objects meet the return criteria.</p>

<p>The declaration of the <strong>GridChecker</strong> class is shown below.</p> 
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public class GridChecker
{
   /** The grid to check; guaranteed never to be null */
   private BoundedGrid gr;

   /** @return an Actor in the grid gr with the most neighbors;
    *  null if no actors in the grid.
    */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public Actor actorWithMostNeighbors()</pre></div>
   { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }
   
   
   /** Returns a list of all occupied locations in the grid gr that are
    *  within 2 rows and 2 columns of loc. The object references in the
    *  returned list may appear in any order.
    *  @param loc a valid location in the grid gr
    *  @return a list of all occupied locations in the grid gr that are 
    *  within 2 rows and 2 columns of loc.
    */
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public List getOccupiedWithinTwo(Location loc)</pre></div>
   { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }


    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods 
    // that are not shown.
}
</pre></div>

<p>The method <strong>actorWithMostNeighbors</strong> returns an Actor in the grid gr that has the most
neighbors. A neighbor of a given actor is another actor that occupies any of the given actor's 8 adjacent
locations. Consider the following examples.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/GridChecker1.gif"></div>


<p>In Example 1, the method actorWithMostNeighbors will return the Actor (in this case a bug) in
location (2, 2). In Example 2, there are three Actor objects that have the same largest number of
neighbors—the rock in location (1, 1), the critter in location (2, 1), and the bug in location (2, 2). In this
case, any one of those three Actor objects may be returned. Similarly, either of the Actor objects
shown in Example 3 could be returned. If there are no Actor objects in the grid, the method returns
null.</p>

/** @return an Actor in the grid gr with the most neighbors;
 *  null if no actors in the grid.
 */
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public Actor actorWithMostNeighbors()</pre></div>


</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method <strong>getOccupiedWithinTwo</strong> returns a list containing all occupied locations in the grid gr
that are within 2 rows and 2 columns of the parameter loc. The location loc is not included in the
returned list, even if that location is occupied. The object references in the returned list may appear in any
order. The shaded area in the following diagram shows the group of locations that are within 2 rows and 2
columns of the location labeled X.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following grid.</p>
