<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves reasoning about the code from the GridWorld case study. A copy of the code is provided as part
   of this exam. An opossum is an animal whose defense is to pretend to be dead. The OpossumCritter class, shown below,
   will be used to represent the opossum in the grid. An OpossumCritter classifies its neighbors as friends, foes,
   or neither. It is possible that a neighbor is neither a friend nor a foe; however, no neighbor is both a friend
   and a foe. If the OpossumCritter has more foes than friends surrounding it, it will simulate playing dead by
   changing its color to black and remaining in the same location. Otherwise, it will behave like a Critter. If the
   OpossumCritter plays dead for three consecutive steps, it is removed from the grid.</p> 

<p>You will implement two of the methods in the following <strong>OpossumCritter</strong> class.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public class OpossumCritter extends Critter
{
    private int numStepsDead;
    
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public OpossumCritter()</pre></div>
    {
        numStepsDead = 0;
        setColor(Color.ORANGE);
    }

     *  this critter and the elements of actors is unchanged.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Override the <strong>processActors</strong> method for the OpossumCritter class. This method should look at
all elements of actors and determine whether or not to play dead according to the types of the actors. If
there are more foes than friends, the OpossumCritter indicates that it is playing dead by changing its
color to Color.BLACK. When not playing dead, it sets its color to Color.ORANGE. The instance
variable numStepsDead should be updated to reflect the number of consecutive steps the OpossumCritter has played dead.</p>

<p>Complete method <strong>processActors</strong> below.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**  Whenever actors contains more foes than friends, this OpossumCritter
  *  plays dead.
  *  Postcondition: (1) The state of all actors in the grid other than this

</li>
<li>
<p>Override the <strong>selectMoveLocation</strong> method for the OpossumCritter class. 
  When the OpossumCritter is not playing dead, it behaves like a Critter. The next location for
  an OpossumCritter that has been playing dead for three consecutive steps is null. Otherwise, 
  an OpossumCritter that is playing dead remains in its current location.</p> 

<p>Complete method <strong>selectMoveLocation</strong> below.</p>
