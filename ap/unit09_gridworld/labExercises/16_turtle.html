<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>A <strong>Turtle</strong> is a Critter. A Turtle is a Critter in every way except that
  it only has a lifespan of 10 steps. After 10 steps a Turtle dies and is removed from the grid. Turtles cannot eat TurtleEggs.</p>

<p>A <strong>MaleTurtle</strong> is a Turtle. A MaleTurtle is a Turtle in every way except that it is always the color blue.</p>

<p>A <strong>FemaleTurtle</strong> is a Turtle. A FemaleTurtle is a Turtle in every way except that it lays
   an egg when it comes in contact with a MaleTurtle. The egg is laid in a location, selected at random, from a
   list of unoccupied locations surrounding the FemaleTurtle. A FemaleTurtle is always green.</p>

<p>A <strong>TurtleEgg</strong> is an Actor. A TurtleEgg is an Actor in every way except that after being laid it incubates
   for a period of 5 steps then it becomes a Turtle. The Turtle hatched from the egg has a 50% chance of either being a MaleTurtle
   or a FemaleTurtle.</p>

<br>

<p>Implement the <strong>Turtle</strong> class. Include an instance variable of type int named <strong>lifespan</strong>.
   Initialize lifespan with a value of 10 in a constructor. Remember that Turtles cannot eat TurtleEggs.</p>

<p>Redefine the Turtle class's <strong>act</strong> method using the code below. Notice the addition of a check
   to see if the grid is equal to null. This is necessary because Turtles remove themselves from the grid in the
   processActors method when they reach the end of their lifespan. The methods getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations,
   and makeMove can no longer be executed if the Turtle is not associated with a grid.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void act()
{
     <div id="csHighlight"><pre>if (getGrid() == null)
        return;</pre></div> 
     ArrayList&ltActor&gt actors = getActors();
     processActors(actors);
     if(getGrid() != null)
     {
         ArrayList&ltLocation&gt moveLocs = getMoveLocations();
         Location loc = selectMoveLocation(moveLocs);
         makeMove(loc);
     }
}
</pre></div> 

<p>Implement the <strong>MaleTurtle</strong> class. Initialize its color attribute to blue in a constructor.</p>

<p>Implement the <strong>FemaleTurtle</strong> class. Initialize its color attribute to green in a constructor.<br>
   Include in your implementation the behavior described above.</p>
   
<p>Implement the <strong>TurtleEgg</strong> class. Include in your implementation the behavior described above.</p>


<br>
<p>Use the <strong>TurtleRunner</strong> class below to test your new classes.</p>
  <p>Copy the following code into a file named <strong>TurtleRunner.java</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
  <pre>
import info.gridworld.grid.*;
import info.gridworld.actor.*;
import java.awt.Color;

public class TurtleRunner
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ActorWorld world = new ActorWorld();

        FemaleTurtle femaleTurtle = new FemaleTurtle();
        MaleTurtle maleTurtle = new MaleTurtle();

        world.add(new Location(5,5), femaleTurtle);
        world.add(new Location(4,4), maleTurtle);

        world.show();
