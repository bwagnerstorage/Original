<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A friend of yours has decided to go on a diet and has asked you to write a program that will
     help him track his progress. The program should allow him to make daily entries into a database,
	 where each entry includes the day's date and his current weight. The program should be able to
	 print a summary report which displays the date, weight, and weight differentrial for each entry
	 in the database. The weight differential is the difference between the current weight and the
	 weight recorded on the previous entry. The summary report should also include a net weight 
	 loss/gain value. This value represents the amount of weight lossed or gained from the first
	 entry in the database to the last entry.</p>

<h3>Class Decomposition</h3>
<p>Your implementation should be decomposed into the following 3 classes:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Entry class</li>
<li>Diet class</li>
<li>Manager class</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Entry Class</h3>
<p>This class represents a single entry into the diet database. It's attributes include a
   String field for the entry date and a integer field for the weight. You will need to include
   constructors, accessor methods, mutator methods, and override the toString method.</p>

<h3>Diet Class</h3>
<p>This class is responsible for creating and maintaining the diet database through
   an Arraylist of Entry objects. It also needs to track the weight differential and the
   net weight loss/gain attributes. The weight differential is defined as the weight difference
   between two consecutive entries in the list. If the person weighted 179 on 8-21 and then 177
   on 8-22 then the weight differential would be -2. The net weight loss/gain value represents 
   the amount of weight lossed or gained since the first entry in database.</p>

<p>The Diet class should include the following methods:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p><strong>default constructor</strong> - initializes the ArrayList, weight differential, net weight loss/gain
 variables. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>addEntry</strong> method - adds an Entry object to the ArrayList.</p> </li>
<li><p><strong>getEntry</strong> method - given a date (String), this method searches the ArrayList, using a linear search algorithm, for an Entry that contains the specified date. If found it returns the Entry object, otherwise it returns null.
(Linear Search - you simply examine each element in a list one by one until the desired element
   is found or you reach the end of the list.)</p> </li>
<li><p><strong>viewList</strong> method - this method prints a summary report of the database including the list
   of entrys, the weight differential, and the net weight loss/gain values. </p></li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Manager Class</h3>
<p>This class is the manager for the program. It is responsible for displaying and managing its
   menu system and instaniating the Diet object. It contains the main method for the program.</p>

<p>This class should contain the following methods:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p><strong>default constructor</strong> - the constructor should instaniate the Diet object and an Scanner object.
    It should also call the method MainMenu to start the menu system.</p> </li>
<li><p><strong>mainMenu</strong> method - this method is responsible for displaying the main menu for 
the program.</p></li> 
<li><p><strong>addRecord</strong> method - this method allows the user to make an entry into the diet database
   by providing a date and weight.</p></li> 
<li><p><strong>viewRecord</strong> method - this method allows the user to view a single
 record (Entry) within the database by providing its date. If the entry is not in the database
 the method should display the message "Entry does not exist".</p></li> 
<li><p><strong>viewAllRecords</strong> method - this method allows the user to view all of the records
   in the database including a summary report with the weight differential and the net weight
   loss/gain values.</p></li> 
</ul></div>
