<h1>Introduction to the Magpie Class</h1>

<p>To run Magpie follow these steps:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>Download the NetBean's MagPie workspace provide in the section <strong>MagPie Workspace</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the file <strong>MagpieRunner2</strong>, compile and execute.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Get to know the Magpie class by typing in the following responses:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>My mother and I talked last night.</p></li>
<li><p>I said no!</p></li>
<li><p>The weather is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know my brother?</p></li>
</ul></div>
<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Look at the code. See how the if statement assigns a value to the response and returns that response.
The method <strong>getRandomResponse</strong> picks a response from a group of String objects.</p>
<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>Alter the code:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li><p>Have it respond "Tell me more about your pets" when the statement contains the word "dog" or
"cat." For example, a possible statement and response would be:</p>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong> I like my cat Mittens.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Tell me more about your pets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have it respond favorably when it sees the name of your teacher. Be sure to use appropriate
pronouns! If the statement contains the salutation "Mr." then the response should include the "he" pronoun,
if the statement contains the salutations "Mrs.", "Ms." or "Miss" the response should include the "she" pronoun, and
finally if the statement does not contain a salutation then use "he/she" in the response. For example,</p>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong> Mr. Finkelstein is telling us about robotics.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> He sounds like a good teacher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have the code check that the statement has at least one character. You can do this by using the
trim method to remove spaces from the beginning and end, and then checking the length of
the trimmed string. If there are no characters, the response should tell the user to enter
something. For example, a possible statement and response would be:</p>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Say something, please.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add two more noncommittal responses to the possible random responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick three more keywords, such as "no" and "brother" and edit the getResponse method to
respond to each of these.</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string "My
mother has a dog but no cat." Explain to your neighbor how you might prioritize responses in the reply method.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1>Question</h1>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li><p>What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like "I know
all the state capitals" and "I like vegetables smothered in cheese." Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements.</p></li>
</ol></div>
