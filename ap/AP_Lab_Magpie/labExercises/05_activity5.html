<div id="csAssignmentTitle" align="center">Magpie Lab - Activity 5</div>

<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When you last worked with the Magpie, <strong>default responses</strong> were handled with a nested if statement.
This certainly worked, and you could add more responses, but it was a bit awkward. An easier way to
keep track of default responses is with an <strong>array</strong>. In this activity, you will see how an array makes
handling default responses much easier.</p>

<h1>Prepare</h1>
<p>You are going to use the <strong>Activity5</strong> project in this activity. You will need to make Activity5 the active project.
This can be accomplished by right-clicking on the project name and selecting <strong>Sets as Active Project</strong>.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Run this version of the Magpie class. You should see no difference in its outward behavior. Instead, it
has been changed so that its internal structure is different. This is called <strong>code refactoring</strong>. That's one of
the big benefits of dealing with methods as black boxes. As long as they perform the action required,
the user does not care about how they perform the action.</p>

<h1>Exercise</h1>
<p>Notice at the the top of the Magpie5 class an array of strings named RANDOM_RESPONSES has been defined. The definition
   includes the use of the keywords "static" and "final". Recall that when you declare a variable with final modifier
   the variable becomes a constant and it data cannot be altered. The will cover the static modifier later. The reason for 
   including the static and final modifiers is to improve the efficiency of the array.</p>
<div id="csOutput"><pre>
private static final String[] RANDOM_RESPONSES = {
   "Interesting, tell me more",
   "Hmmm.",
   "Do you really think so?",
   "You don't say."
};
</pre></div>
<p>Using an intializer list {} the array includes 4 random responses. </p>
<br>
<ul id="csList">
  <li>Your first task is to add four more responses to the array. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Method getRandomResponse</h2>
<p>The random responses are generated in a method named <strong>getRandomResponse</strong>. It is declared at
   the very bottom of the class. You are going to implement this method.</p>
   
<h3>Generating Random Numbers</h3>
<p>Recall that one way to create a random number in Java is to use the Math class's <strong>random</strong> method. Look at
   the following code segment:</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
int r = (int)(Math.random() * 8);
</pre>
</div>
<p>This code will generate a random number in the range of 0 to 7.</p>
<h3>Array length Variable</h3>
<p>Look at the next code segment that is a slight modification to the one above.</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
int r = (int)(Math.random() * RANDOM_RESPONSES.length;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Recall that an array has access to a variable named <strong>length</strong> that keeps track of the size of the array.
   By replacing the number 8 with the name of the array and the length variable we are able to generate a random
   number in the range of 0 to length of the array - 1. For example, if the array is size 10 then the random numbers
   generated would be in the range of 0 to 9 which corresponds to indexing numbers use to access the contents of the array.</p>
<br>
<ul id="csList">
<li>Your task is to implement the <strong>getRandomResponse</strong> method so that it returns one of the responses from the array
    chosen at random. If you need an array refresher refer to the PRE-AP course Unit 18.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Compile and run your code. You should run it until you see all of your new responses.</p>
