<p>A <strong>SpiderFood</strong> is a Bug. A SpiderFood behaves like a Bug in every way, except that it can be paralyzed
   by Spiders. When a SpiderFood gets too close to a Spider it is paralyzed and can no longer move to a new location,
   instead it just makes a turn.</p>
<p>A <strong>Spider</strong> is a Critter. A Spider behaves like a Critter in every way, except that instead of eating
   its prey it paralyzes them so that it can eat them later. However, the only kind of bug that a Spider can paralyze is SpiderFood.</p>

<p>Implement the <strong>SpiderFood</strong> class. Include an instance variable of type boolean named <strong>paralyzed</strong>.
   This variable is initially assigned a value of false but becomes true when a SpiderFood is paralyzed by a Spider. 
   Provide a mutator method for the paralyzed variable so that can be called by a Spider to paralyze a SpiderFood. 
   Redefine the <strong>act</strong> method so it reflects the behavior described above.</p>

<p>Implement the <strong>Spider</strong> class so that it has the behavior described above.</p>

<br>
<p>Use the <strong>SpiderRunner</strong> class below to test your two new classes.</p>
  <p>Copy the following code into a file named <strong>SpiderRunner.java</strong>.</p>
