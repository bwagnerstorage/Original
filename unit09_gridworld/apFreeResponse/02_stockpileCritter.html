<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves reasoning about the code from the GridWorld case study. A copy of the code is provided as part of this exam.</p>
<p>A <strong>StockpileCritter</strong> is a Critter that uses other actors as a source of energy.
   Each actor represents one unit of energy. The StockpileCritter behaves like a Critter except in the way
   that it interacts with other actors. Each time the StockpileCritter acts, it gathers all neighboring actors
   by removing them from the grid and keeps track of them in a stockpile. The StockpileCritter then attempts
   to reduce its stockpile by one unit of energy. If the stockpile is empty, the StockpileCritter runs out of energy
   and removes itself from the grid.</p> 

<p>Consider the following scenario.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/StockpileCritter1.gif"></div>
 

<p>Write the complete <strong>StockpileCritter</strong> class, including all instance variables and required methods.
Do NOT override the act method. Remember that your design must not violate the postconditions of the
methods of the Critter class and that updating an object's instance variable changes the state of that object.</p>
