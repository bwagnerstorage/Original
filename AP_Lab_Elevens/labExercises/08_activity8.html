<h1>Using an Abstract Board Class</h1>
<p>The Elevens game belongs to a set of related solitaire games. In this activity you will learn about some of
these related games. Then you will see how inheritance can be used to reuse the code that is common to
all of these games without rewriting it.</p>

<h1>Exploration: Related Games</h1>
<h3>Thirteens</h3>
<p>A game related to Elevens, called Thirteens, uses a 10-card board. Ace, 2, ... , 10, jack, queen correspond
to the point values of 1, 2, ..., 10, 11, 12. Pairs of cards whose point values add up to 13 are selected and
removed. Kings are selected and removed singly. Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 out of 2.</p>
<h3>Tens</h3>
<p>Another relative of Elevens, called Tens, uses a 13-card board. Pairs of cards whose point values add to 10
are selected and removed, as are quartets of kings, queens, jacks, and tens, all of the same rank (for
example, King of Clubs, King of Diamonds, King of Hearts, and King of Spades). Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 in 8 games.</p>

<h1>Exploration: Abstract Classes</h1>
<p>In reading the descriptions of Elevens and its related games, it is evident that these games share common
state and behaviors. Each game requires:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p><strong>State</strong> (instance variables) - a deck of cards and the cards "on the" board.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behavior</strong> (methods) - to deal the cards, to remove and replace selected cards, to check for a win,
to check if selected cards satisfy the rules of the game, to see if there are more legal selections
available, and so on.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>With all of this state and behavior in common, it would seem that inheritance could allow us to write code
once and reuse it, instead of having to copy it for each different game.</p>
<p>But how? If we use the "IS-A" test, a ThirteensBoard "IS-A" ElevensBoard is not true. They
have a lot in common, but an inheritance relationship between the two does not exist. So how do we
create an inheritance hierarchy to take advantage of the commonalities between these two related boards?</p>

<p>The answer is to use a common superclass. Take all the state and behavior that these boards have in
common and put them into a new Board class. Then have ElevensBoard, TensBoard, and
ThirteensBoard inherit from the Board class. This makes sense because each of them is just a
different kind of board. An ElevensBoard "IS-A" Board, a ThirteensBoard "IS-A"
Board, and a TensBoard "IS-A" Board. A diagram that shows the inheritance relationships of
these classes is included below. Note that Board is shown as abstract. We'll discuss why later.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/Elevens4.png"></div>

<p>Let's see how this works out for dividing up our original ElevensBoard code from Activity 7.
Because all these games need a deck and the cards on the board, all of the instance variables can go into
Board. Some methods, like deal, will work the same for every game, so they should be in Board
too. Methods like containsJQK are Elevens-specific and should be in ElevensBoard. So far,
so good.</p>
<p>But what should we do with the isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible methods? Every
Elevens-related game will have both of these methods, but they need to work differently for each different
game. That's exactly why Java has abstract methods. Because each of these games needs isLegal
and anotherPlayIsPossible methods, we include those methods in Board. However, because
the implementation of these methods depends on the specific game, we make them abstract in
Board and don't include their implementations there. Also, because Board now contains
abstract methods, it must also be specified as abstract. Finally, we override each of these
abstract methods in the subclasses to implement their specific behavior for that game.</p>
<p>But if we have to implement isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible in each game-specific
board class, why do we need to have the abstract methods in Board? Consider a class the uses a
board, such as the GUI program you used in Activity 6. Such a class is called a client of the Board class.</p>

<p>The GUI program does not actually need to know what kind of a game it is displaying! It only knows that
the board that was provided "IS-A" Board, and it only "knows" about the methods in the Board
class. The GUI program is only able to call isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible because
they are included in Board.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to understand how the GUI program is able to execute the correct isLegal and
anotherPlayIsPossible methods. When the GUI program starts, it is provided an object of a
class that inherits from Board. If you want to play Elevens, you provide an ElevensBoard object.
If you want to play Tens, you provide a TensBoard object. So, when the GUI program uses that object
to call isLegal or anotherPlayIsPossible, it automatically uses the method implementation
included in that particular object. This is known as <strong>polymorphism</strong>.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>

<li><p>Discuss the similarities and differences between Elevens, Thirteens, and Tens.</p></li>
<li><p>As discussed previously, all of the instance variables are declared in the Board class. But it is the
ElevensBoard class that "knows" the board size, and the ranks, suits, and point values of the
cards in the deck. How do the Board instance variables get initialized with the ElevensBoard
values? What is the exact mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>Now examine the files Board.java, and ElevensBoard.java.. Identify the abstract methods in Board.java. See how these
methods are implemented in ElevensBoard. Do they cover all the differences between Elevens,
Thirteens, and Tens as discussed in question 1? Why or why not?</p></li>
