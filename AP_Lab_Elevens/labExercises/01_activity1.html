<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The following activities are
related to a simple solitaire game
called Elevens. You will learn the
rules of Elevens, and will be able
to play it by using the supplied
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
shown at the right. You will learn
about the design and the Object
Oriented Principles that
suggested that design. You will also implement much of the code.</p>

<h1>Design and Create a Card Class</h1>
<p>In this activity, you will complete a Card class that will be used to create card objects.</p>
<p>Think about card games you've played. What kinds of information do these games require a card object to
"know"? What kinds of operations do these games require a card object to provide?</p>
<h1>Prepare for Lesson</h1>
<p>Download the JCreator Elevens workspace provide in the section <strong>Elevens Workspace</strong></p>
<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Now think about implementing a class to represent a playing card. What instance variables should it have?
What methods should it provide? Discuss your ideas for this Card class with classmates.</p>
<p>Read the partial implementation of the Card class available in the Activity1 Project. As you read
through this class, you will notice the use of the <strong>@Override</strong> annotation before the toString method.
The Java @Override annotation can be used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in a
superclass. In this example, the Object class's toString method is being overridden in the Card class.
If the indicated method doesn't override a method, then the Java compiler will give an error message.</p>
<p>Here's a situation where this facility comes in handy. Programmers new to Java often encounter problems
matching headings of overridden methods to the superclass's original method heading. For example, in the
Weight class below, the tostring method is intended to be invoked when toString is called for a
Weight object.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
public class Weight {
   private int pounds;
   private int ounces;
      ...
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public String tostring(String str)</pre></div> {
       return this.pounds + " lb. " + this.ounces + " oz.";
   }
   ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately, this <strong>doesn't work</strong>; the tostring method given above has a different name and a different
signature from the Object class's toString method. The correct version below has the correct name
toString and no parameter:</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public String toString(String str)</pre></div> {
       return this.pounds + " lb. " + this.ounces + " oz.";
   }
   ...
}
</pre></div>
<p>The <strong>@Override</strong> annotation would cause an error message for the first tostring version to alert the
programmer of the errors.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>Complete the implementation of the provided Card class. You will be required to complete:</p>
<div id="csList2"><ol>
<li><p>a <strong>constructor</strong> that takes two String parameters that represent the card's rank and suit, and an int
parameter that represents the point value of the card;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>accessor methods</strong> for the card's rank, suit, and point value;</p></li>
<li><p>an <strong>equals</strong> method to test equality between two card objects; and</p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>toString</strong> method to create a String that contains the rank, suit, and point value of the card
object. The string should be in the following format:</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
rank of suit (point value = pointValue)
</pre></div>
</li>
</ol></div></li>
<li><p>Once you have completed the Card class, open the CardTester.java file. Create three Card objects and test each method for each Card object.</p></li>
</ol></div>
