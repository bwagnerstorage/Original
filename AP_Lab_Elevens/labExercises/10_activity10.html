<h1>ThirteensBoard</h1>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to create the Thirteens game using the knowledge gained from
implementing the Elevens game.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>The rules for the Thirteens game are repeated below:</p>
<h3>Thirteens</h3>
<p>A game related to Elevens, called Thirteens, uses a 10-card board. Ace, 2, ... , 10, jack, queen correspond
to the point values of 1, 2, ... , 10, 11, 12. Pairs of cards whose point values add up to 13 are selected and
removed. Kings are selected and removed singly. Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 out of 2.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>The Activity10 Project contains all the code for a complete working Elevens game.
Review the code in the ElevensBoard class. Identify the changes that would be necessary to
implement the Thirteens game.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy and paste the ElevensBoard.java file into a new file, ThirteensBoard.java.
Make the necessary changes to this file to implement the Thirteens game.</p></li>
<li><p>The Activity10 Project also contains the ElevensGUIRunner.java file that is
shown below. This program creates the board (an ElevensBoard object). Then it creates the GUI
(a CardGameGUI object). Finally, it displays the GUI by calling its displayGame method.
Review the code in the ElevensGUIRunner class as shown below. Identify the changes that
would be necessary to implement the Thirteens game.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
/**
* This is a class that plays the GUI version of the Elevens game.
* See accompanying documents for a description of how Elevens is played.

      Board board = new ElevensBoard();
      CardGameGUI gui = new CardGameGUI(board);
      gui.displayGame();
   }
}
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>Copy and paste the ElevensGUIRunner.java file into a new file,
ThirteensGUIRunner.java. Make the necessary changes to this file to implement the
Thirteens game.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the ThirteensGUIRunner program and test your new Thirteens game.</p></li>
