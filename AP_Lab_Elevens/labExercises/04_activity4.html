<h1>Adding a Shuffle Method to the Deck Class</h1>
<p>You implemented a Deck class in Activity 2. This class should be complete except for the shuffle
method. You also implemented a DeckTester class that you used to test your incomplete Deck
class.</p>
<p>In Activity 3, you implemented methods in the Shuffler class, which shuffled integers.
Now you will use what you learned about shuffling in Activity 3 to implement the Deck shuffle
method.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li><p>The file Deck.java is a correct solution from
Activity 2. Complete the Deck class by implementing the <strong>shuffle</strong> method. Use the <strong>efficient
selection shuffle</strong> algorithm from Activity 3.</p>
<p>Note that the Deck constructor creates the deck and then calls the shuffle method. The
shuffle method also needs to reset the value of size to indicate that all of the cards can be
dealt again.</p></li>
<li><p>The DeckTester.java file provides a basic set
of Deck tests. It is similar to the DeckTester class you might have written in Activity 2.
Add additional code at the bottom of the <strong>main method</strong> to create a standard deck of 52 cards and
test the shuffle method. You can use the Deck toString method to "see" the cards after
every shuffle.</p></li>
