			   <p>You just completed your first JavaFX program. Lets look at the key features of this program.</p>
		   </li>
		</ol>
		<h1>JavaFX Application class</h1>
		<p>When creating a JavaFX application the program's main class must inherit or extend the <strong>Application</strong> class
		   located in the <strong>javafx.application</strong> package.</p>
		<div id="csCode" style="width:630px"><pre>import <span id="csHighlight"><pre>javafx.application.Application;</pre></span>
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import javafx.event.EventHandler;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
						   
public class JavaFXExercise1 extends <span id="csHighlight"><pre>Application</pre></span> {


}					   
</pre></div>
<p>The Application provides a method called <strong>start</strong> that you will need to override (polymorphism). This method
   is the main entry point into your program so this is where your JavaFX code will go. </p>
   <div id="csCode" style="width:630px"><pre>@Override
public void <span id="csHighlight"><pre>start</pre>(Stage primaryStage) {
	
	/* Your JavaFX code goes here */

}</pre></div>
<div id="csNote">Notice the <strong>@Override</strong> declaration above start's method header. This is an example of <strong>Java annotation</strong>, 
	 this particular annotation insures that the method being overridden, in this case, start, is actually a super class method, if the method is not in a super class because it
	  is misspelled for example, an error would occur at compile time instead of run time. And as you know compile errors are much easier to debug than runtime errors.
	  Annotations are not always required, however, it is consider a good programming practice.</div>
<p>In a standalone (desktop) application the <strong>start</strong> method is executed in the main method by calling another Application class method 
   named <strong>launch</strong>.
</p>
<h1>The Theater</h1>
<p>The start method includes a parameter of type <strong>Stage</strong> named primaryStage. This terminology is borrowed from the 
   theater. The stage in the theater is where the play is performed and viewed by the audience. In JavaFX the <strong>stage</strong> is a window where
   the GUI program is executed and viewed by the user. </p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Stage</h1>
   <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExample1.PNG" width="80%" class="center">
 
 
 <p>A scene in the theater is a set of activities that happen at a particular time on the stage.
   A <strong>scene</strong> in JavaFX is a set of GUI controls or widgets that are on the stage at a particular time. These include buttons, text fields,
   menus, and combo boxes, just to name a few.</p>
   <h1 style="text-align:center">Scene</h1>
   <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExample2.PNG" width="80%" class="center">

   <h1>Building a JavaFX Application</h1>
<p>The process of building a JavaFx application is fairly straightforward. Your first task is to create the controls your program will need to
   interact with the user, next you create a scene and add the controls, and lastly you assign the scene to a stage.</p>

<p>Our HelloWorld program only had one control, a button. Instead of being added directly to a scene it was first added to a StackPane
   and the StackPane was then added to the to the scene. A StackPane helps with the layout or positioning of controls in a scene. You will learn more about panes
   in a future lesson.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:630px"><pre>StackPane root = new StackPane();
root.getChildren().add(btn);
			   
Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);
			   
primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");
primaryStage.setScene(scene);
primaryStage.show();</pre>
</div>
<p>This code is pretty self explanatory.However, there is one concept in this code I would like to look at and that is scene graphs.</p>
<h3>Scene Graph</h3>
 <p>In computer science a <strong>scene graph</strong> is data structure used to organize and manage a variety of media types, most notably 3D graphics and games.
   JavaFX uses scene graphs to organize all the components or controls added to a scene.</p>
   <img src="JavaFX/images/SceneGraph2.png" width="70%" class="center">  
   <p>The scene graph stores the whole scene in the form of a graph of connected objects called nodes. There are two types of nodes: branch nodes and leaf nodes. 
   A branch node is a node that can contain other nodes (child nodes). Branch nodes are also referred to as parent nodes
   because they can contain child nodes. A leaf node is a node which cannot contain other nodes. The <strong>root node</strong> is the first node in the graph. The
   root node does not have a parent.</p>
   <img src="JavaFX/images/SceneGraph1.png" width="70%" class="center">

   <p>Below is the scene graph for our HelloWorld program.</p>
   
   <img src="JavaFX/images/SceneGraph3.png" width="30%" class="center">
   <p>Refer to this code in our HelloWorld program.</p>
   <div id="csCode" style="width:630px"><pre>StackPane root = new StackPane();
root.getChildren().add(btn);
Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);
</pre></div>
<p>In the third line of code a scene object is created. It's constructor assigns the root of its scene graph to the StackPane object named root. It is also
   sets the initial dimensions of the stage's window to 300 x 250. In the second line of code the StackPane object, root, gets a list
   of its current children, then it calls an <code>add</code> method to add the button to this list, which adds the button to the scene graph
   as a child of StackPane.
</p>
