<h1>JavaFX Event Handling</h1>
<p>In JavaFX applications, <strong>events</strong> are notifications that something has happened. As a user clicks a button, 
   presses a key, moves a mouse, or performs other actions, events are dispatched. To respond to a particular event the application
   registers an <strong>event handler</strong> with the event. In Java, an event handler is a method that is invoked when 
   the application is notified by the operating system that the event has occurred, therefore giving the application the opportunity to
   respond to the event. Lets look at our Hello World program from the previous exercise to see how this process works.

   <p>The following code is the start method from the Hello World program. Recall that the start method is called automatically when a JavaFX 
	  application is executed. The event handling code is highlighted in red.
   </p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
   Button btn = new Button();
   btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
   btn.setOnAction(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;() { 
      @Override
      public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
         System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
});
</pre></div>
</pre></div>
<p>The event that the program wants to respond to is a button press. To accomplish this
   the program registers an event handler with the button. This is done by calling the Button class's <strong>setOnAction</strong> method
   which takes an EventHandler as an argument.</p>
<p>EventHandler is an interface that includes only one method named <strong>handle</strong>.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>public interface EventHandler&lt;T extends Event&gt; extends EventListener
{
   void handle(T event)   // T is the type of event that occurred
}
</pre></div>
<p>It is this <strong>handle</strong> method that becomes the event handler for the button press event. This method will be called every time 
   the button is pressed so any code placed inside this method will be executed when the event occurs. In the Hello World program the
   responding code is simply a <code>System.out.println</code> statement.</p>

<h1>Anonymous Inner Class</h1>
<p>The event handling code shown above does something usual. Probably something you might not have seen before. It is using an 
	<strong>Anonymous Inner Class</strong> to register the <code>handle</code> method as the event handler for the button. What the heck is an 
	anonymous inner class? To answer this question lets first define <strong>inner class</strong>. An inner class is a class defined within 
	another class. Lets look at a simple example.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public class Outer 
{
   private int outerVariable = 5;
   private Inner obj = new Inner();
			
   class Inner
   {
      public void change()
      {
         outerVariable = 100;  // can access directly
      }
   }
}
</pre></div>
<p>In our example, Inner class is a member of Outer class, therefore it has direct access to any private variables or methods defined
   within the Outer class.</p>
<p>As the name implies, an <strong>anonymous inner class</strong> is an inner class that is not given a name.</p>
<p>Here are a few rules for declaring an inner class.</p>
<ul id="csList">
	<li>An anonymous inner class must extend another class or implement an interface but it cannot do both.</li>
	<li>An anonymous inner class can override a super class method.</li>
	<li>An anonymous inner class cannot have constructors.</li>
	<li>An anonymous inner class can add other fields(instance variables) and methods.</li>
	<li>An anonymous inner class can only create one object.</li>
</ul>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;() {
					
   @Override
   public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
});
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the event handler code again you can see that the anonymous class being defined implements the EventHandler interface which
	requires the class to implement the <code>handle</code> method. The keyword <strong>new</strong> is used in Java to instantiate objects. Therefore
	this code is both defining a class and creating an object of the class at the same time. The object created becomes the argument needed
	by the Button class's <code>setOnAction</code> method.
</p>

<p>JavaFX does not require you to use inner classes. Below I have modified the start method so that it does not use an anonymous inner class.
   First, I define a new class named <strong>MyButtonHandler</strong> that implements the <code>EventHandler</code> interface, I then override the <code>handle</code> method, and finally I modify the 
   <code>start</code> method so that the <code>Button</code> class's <code>setOnAction</code> method takes a <code>MyButtonHandler</code> object as its argument.
</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>
class MyButtonHandler implements EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;
{       
   @Override
   public void handle(ActionEvent event) 
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
} 
</pre></div>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
   Button btn = new Button();
   btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
   btn.setOnAction(<span id="csHighlight"><pre>new MyButtonHandler()</pre></span>);
}
</pre></div>
<h3>When should you use Anonymous Inner Classes?</h3>
<p>If you have a program that needs one object of a class and that class does not declare a constructor and it
	does not implement very many methods then it is a good candidate for an anonymous inner class. The benefit of using an inner class is 
	the class has access to all the fields and methods of the outer class eliminating the need for parameter passing. The program also
	becomes smaller in size because the class does not need to be defined in the traditional way.
</p>
<h1>Lambda Expressions in Java 8</h1>
<p>With the release of Java 8, Java developers introduced a shortcut for writing anonymous inner classes called <strong>lambda expressions</strong>.
   Lambda expressions are used to create instances of <strong>functional interfaces</strong>. A functional interface is an interface
   that only contains <strong>one</strong> abstract method. Some examples of functional interfaces included Comparable, Runnable, and of course
   EventHandler, the one we have been using in this exercise. The object created by the lambda function implements
   and executes a functional interface's single abstract method. In essence, lambda expressions create methods that do not belong to any class.</p>
   <img src="JavaFX/images/Lambda1.png" width="80%" class="center">

<p>Let's convert our code that uses an anonymous inner class to an lambda expression. Here is the code again using the anonymous inner class.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
   Button btn = new Button();
   btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
   btn.setOnAction(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;() {     
      @Override
      public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
         System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }</pre></div>
   });

   . . .
}

</pre></div>

      <p>Now here is the code using a lambda expression. Remember the only reason we can use a lambda expression here is because the 
         EventHandler interface is a functional interface which means it only has one abstract method named handle.
      </p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
   Button btn = new Button();
   btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
   btn.setOnAction(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>(ActionEvent event) -> System.out.println("Hello World!");</pre></div>);

   . . .
}
</pre></div>
<P>Notice that the lambda expression does not even need to know the name of the method it is implementing, in this case, handle. This is because the EventHandler
   interface only has one method so the compiler is able to determine which method it is implementing.</P>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>Modify the Hello World program so that it includes the following changes:</p>
   <ol id="csList">
     <li><p>Change the name displayed on the button to "Random".</p></li>
     <li><p>Modify the code in the <strong>handle</strong> method so that generates and displays a random number between 1 and 1000 each time it is pressed.</p></li>
     <li><p>Change the line of code</p>
        <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>StackPane root = new StackPane();</pre></div>
           <p>to the following</p>
           <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>VBox root = new VBox();</pre></div>
           <p>VBox is a layout pane that positions controls vertically within the window.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create a second button that displays the name "Count".</p></li>
    <li><p>Use an anonymous inner class to provide event handling for the button. Make sure to use the Button class's <strong>setOnAction</strong>
           method to register the event handler with the button.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add code to its <strong>handle</strong> method so that when the button is pressed it will display a counter variable's value on the console window.
               For example, the first time the button is pressed it will display the number 1, the second time the button is pressed it will display
               the number 2, the third time is it pressed it will display the number 3, and so on.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Modify the event handlers of both buttons so that they use a lambda expression instead of an anonymous inner class.</p></li>
