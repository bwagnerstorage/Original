<h1>BorderPane</h1>
<p>The BorderPane layout pane provides five regions in which to place nodes: top, bottom, left, right, and center. 
   The regions can be any size. If your application does not need one of the regions, you do not need to define it
   and no space is allocated for it.</p>
   <div style="display: flex">
   <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExercise6_4.png" width="70%" style="margin:auto">
  </div>
   <p>A border pane is useful for the classic look of a tool bar at the top, a status bar at the bottom, a navigation
      panel on the left, additional information on the right, and a working area in the center. If the window is larger
      than the space needed for the contents of each region, the extra space is given to the center region by default.

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
  <p>In this exercise, we will use a BorderPane as our base layout, then we will add other panes to the different regions of the 
     BorderPane to better refine the placement of the UI controls. When complete your GUI window should look like the following:</p>
     <div style="display: flex">
        <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExercise6_5.png" width="70%" style="margin:auto">
     </div>

     <li><P>In the project JavaFxExercise, double-click on the file FXML_BorderPane.fxml to open it in Scene Builder.</P></li>
     <li><p>Notice that the scene graph hierarchy already contains an <strong>BorderPane</strong> at its root level.</p></li>
      <li><p>From the Controls panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>MenuBar</strong> control onto the Top region of the BorderPane. By default, the menubar comes
             with three menus included.</p></li>       
      <li><p>From the Preview menu select Show Preview in Window. Resize the window. Notice that the menubar expands horizontally
             to fill the extra space.</p></li>
      <li><p>From the Containers panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>ScrollPane (empty)</strong> onto the Left Region of the BorderPane. 
             A ScrollPane provides both horizontal and vertical scroll bars for data that cannot be viewed within the current
             window size.</p></li>
      <li><p>In the Layout panel for the ScrollPane, make the following changes:</p>
          <ul id="csList2">
            <li><p>Set Min Height value to 80.</p></li>
            <li><p>Set Pref Width value to 150.</p></li>
            <li><p>Set Pref Height value to 245.</p></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>From the Containers panel, drag-and-drop an <strong>Accordion</strong> pane on top of the ScrollPane.</p></li>
      <li><p>From the Preview menu select Show Preview in Window. Click on one of accordion toggles to expand it. Resize the window vertically
             until a vertical scroll bar appears.</p></li>
      <li><p>From the Containers panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>TabsPane</strong> onto the Center Region of the BorderPane.</p></li>
      <li><p>From the Containers panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>BorderPane</strong> onto the Bottom Region of the main BorderPane.  
      <li><p>From the Controls panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>Button</strong> control onto the Left region of this second BorderPane. </p></li>  
      <li><p>From the Controls panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>Button</strong> control onto the Right region of this second BorderPane. </p></li> 
      <li><p>From the Controls panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>Label</strong> control onto the Left region of this second BorderPane. Change
             the text of this label to "Status Bar" and change its font size to System 18px.</p></li> 
      <li><p>From the Preview menu select Show Preview in Window. Resize the window and notice how the different layout panes respond.</p></li>
