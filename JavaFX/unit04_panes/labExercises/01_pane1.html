<h1>Layout Panes</h1>
<p>JavaFX provides a set of classes called <strong>panes</strong>. The purpose of these panes are to provide an easy way to
   manage the user interface of a JavaFX application. These panes are containers for storing UI controls, as well as other panes, so that
   the controls can be arrange on the scene in an organized visually appealing manner.</p>

<p>A JavaFX application can <strong>manually</strong> lay out the UI by setting the position and size properties for each control. However, an easier
   option is to make use of layout panes. JavaFX provides several layout panes for the easy setup and management of classic 
   layouts such as rows, columns, stacks, tiles, and others. As a window is resized, the layout pane automatically repositions and
   resizes the nodes that it contains according to the properties of the individual nodes.</p>

<p>In this unit, I am not going to discuss the ends and outs of each layout pane, I will provide links below that can provide this information, 
   instead I am going to demonstrate the advantage of placing layout panes inside other layout panes. You will see that by nesting layout panes 
   even more refined positioning of elements on a scene can be achieved by taking advantage of the layout properties provided by each pane. 
</p>

<h1>AnchorPane</h1>
<p>Before we start this exercise I would like to take a look at a pane that we have already used several times in our exercises,
   namely the <strong>AnchorPane</strong>. Although we have used this pane, we have never actually discussed the layout properties of this container. An
   AnchorPane is divided into four regions: North, South, East, and West. When nodes (i.g. controls, containers) are placed within a pane they are attached to one or more of these regions.
   If a node's region or regions is not explicitly assigned, then by default, the AnchorPane class attaches the node to both the North and West regions.
   The effects of these attachments is best understood by looking at a demonstration.
</p>
<h3>Download AnchorPane Demo</h3>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Click on the following link to download a NetBeans JavaFX project: 
      <a href="JavaFX/workspaces/AnchorPaneDemo.zip" style="color:blue; font-size: 14px">AnchorPane</a></p></li>
<li><p>Copy the AnchorPane folder in the zip file to your work folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the project <strong>AnchorPane</strong> in NetBeans.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click on the file FXML_AnchorPane.fxml to open it in Scene Builder. You should see the following scene window.</p>
  <img src="JavaFX/images/AnchorPaneDemo1.PNG" style="border: 1px gray solid; width:75%">
  <p>Looking at Hierarchy panel you will notice that there is an AnchorPane at the root level of the scene graph and it 
     has three children: a Button, a Label, and a TextArea.</p>
  <img src="JavaFX/images/AnchorPaneDemo2.PNG" style="border: 1px gray solid">
</li>
<li><p>Click on the Preview Menu on the menubar and select <strong>Show Preview in Window</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Position the mouse over the right edge of the window so that the mouse cursor changes to a double arrow. Now click the
       left mouse button and drag the mouse to enlarge the size of the window horizontally. Notice how the UI controls responded
       to the resizing. Now do the same process for the other three edges of the window. Which two window edges (regions) had an
       effect on the position of the controls? If you said Top (North) and Left (West) then you are correct. Since I did not explicitly
       assign a region to any of the controls they were automatically attached or <strong>glued</strong> to the North and West regions.
</p></li>
<li><p>Close the preview window.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Button control to select it. Then toggle the Layout panel. You should see the Anchor Pane Constraints controller at the top of
       the panel.</p>
       <img src="JavaFX/images/AnchorPaneDemo3.PNG" style="border: 1px gray solid"> 
    <p>This controller is where you attach nodes to the different regions of the AnchorPane.</p>     
</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <strong>horizontal bar</strong> that extends from the square in the middle of the controller. This will highlight the controller in red
       like the image below.</p>
       <img src="JavaFX/images/AnchorPaneDemo4.PNG" style="border: 1px gray solid"> 
    <p>This will attach the Button to the AnchorPane's East region. The number that appears in the textbox is the distance the Button's right edge is
       from the right edge of window.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a preview Window and resize the window's right edge to see the effect this attachment has on the button.</p></li>
<li><p>While the button is still attached to the East region, use the controller to also attach the button to the West region.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a preview Window and resize the window again to see the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Now play around with the controller and the other UI controls until you have a good understanding of how the AnchorPane works. More 
       than one control can be attached to the same region or regions.
</p></li>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>In this first exercise we will be placing two GridPanes inside an AnchorPane and a VBox inside a GridPane. The final product should look like the following window.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExercise6_1.png" style="border: 1px gray solid; width:50%"> 
</div>
<br>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>Click on the following link to download the NetBeans JavaFX project for this exercise: 
         <a href="JavaFX/workspaces/JavaFXExercise6.zip" style="color:blue; font-size: 14px">JavaFXExercise6</a></p></li>
    <li><p>Copy the JavaFXExercise6 folder in the zip file to your work folder.</p></li>
   <li><p>Open the project JavaFxExercise6 in NetBeans.</p></li>
   <li><P>Double-click on the file FXML_GridPane.fxml to open it in Scene Builder.</P></li>
   <li><p>Notice that the scene graph hierarchy already contains an <strong>AnchorPane</strong> at its root level. We are going to use the default settings
          for this container.</p></li>
   <li><p>Under the Controls panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>Label</strong> control centered at the top of the window. Change the
          text of the label to "Seminar Registration". Change the font to System 28px.</p></li>
  <li><p>Under the Containers panel, drag-and-drop a <strong>GridPane</strong> container onto the window below the Label. <br>
         The GridPane container is grid consisting of rows and columns. By default, Scene Builder creates a 2x3 grid consisting of
         2 columns and 3 rows. By placing the GridPane container inside an AnchorPane container we are able to position the grid
         exactly where we want it and it will be anchored or glued to that location. </p></li>
  <li><p>In our example we need 6 rows in the grid. To add rows do the following:</p>
  
    <ul id="csList2">
        <li><p>Right-click on the label for row 2 and select <strong>Add Row Below</strong> from the drop down menu.</p>
        <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExercise6_2.png" style="border: 1px gray solid; width:50%">
        </li>
        <li><p>Repeat these steps until you have 6 rows, labelled from 0 to 5.</p></li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>Under the Layout panel for the GridPane make the following changes:</p>
        <ul id="csList2">
          <li><p>Change the <strong>Pre Width</strong> value to 325.</p></li>
          <li><p>Change the <strong>Pre Height</strong> value to 240.</p></li>
          <li><p>Change the <strong>Layout X</strong > value to 35.</p></li> 
          <li><p>Change the <strong>Layout Y</strong> value to 100.</p></li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>In column 0 of the grid, drag-and-drop 5 <strong>Labels</strong>, one for each row of the grid.</p></li>
  <li><p>In column 1 of the grid, drag-and-drop 5 <strong>TextFields</strong>, one for each row of the grid.
         The window should look like the following:</p>
        
         <img src="JavaFX/images/JavaFXExercise6_3.png" style="border: 1px gray solid; width:50%">
        
    </li>
    <li><p>Change the text of the 5 <strong>Labels</strong> to the following: First Name, Last Name, Address, Home Phone, Cell Phone, and Email Address.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop a second <strong>GridPane</strong> onto the window below the first GridPane.</p></li>
    <li><p>Under the Layout panel for the GridPane make the following changes:</p>
      <ul id="csList2">
        <li><p>Change the <strong>Pre Width</strong> value to 315.</p></li>
        <li><p>Change the <strong>Pre Height</strong> value to 180.</p></li>
        <li><p>Change the <strong>Layout X</strong> value to 35.</p></li> 
        <li><p>Change the <strong>Layout Y</strong> value to 365.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>In column 0 of grid, drag-and-drop 3 <strong>Labels</strong>, one for each row of the grid.</p></li>
    <li><p>Change the text of the 3 <strong>Labels</strong> to the following: Course, Date, and Meals.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop a <strong>ComboBox</strong> on to the grid at location row 0, col 1.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop a <strong>Date Picker</strong> on to the grid at location row 1, col 1.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop a <strong>VBox</strong> container on to the grid at location row 2, col 1. A VBox is a
           container that aligns nodes vertically.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop 3 <strong>CheckBoxes</strong> into the VBox. Name them Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.</p></li>
    <li><p>For the Breakfast and Lunch check boxes set their bottom padding to 10 in the layout panel.</p></li>
    <li><p>Drag-and-drop 2 <strong>Buttons</strong> in the bottom right corner of the window. Name the button on the right "Next" and
           the button on the left "Cancel". Set the <strong>Pref Width</strong> of each button to 60.</p></li>
    <li><p>From the Preview menu select Show Preview in Window.
    Your window should look like the following:</p>
