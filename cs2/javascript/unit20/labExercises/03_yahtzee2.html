<h3>Player Interface</h3>
<p>Our yahtzee game's player interface has been updated with the addition of two more components.
   A second button has been added named "Reset Turn" and a div has been placed between the two buttons
   to display the number of dice rolls a player has left.</p>
<img src="images/javascript_yahtzee2-1.png" style="width:70%; height:70%"><br>
<p>In yahtzee a player has a maximum of three dice rolls per turn. After the third roll a player must 
   must choose a category on the scorecard to place his score.</p>
<p>Look at the yahtzee object introduced in the previous lesson. A new field has been added named 
    <strong>numRolls</strong>. This variable will be used to track the number of dice rolls a player
    has left in the current turn. numRolls starts with a value of 3 and is decreased each dice roll
    until it has a value of zero.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
function yahtzee() 
{
    this.context = null;  // reference to canvas context
    this.dice = [];       // array representing 5 dice
    this.images = [];     // array to store 6 die images
    this.loadCount = 0;   // count of number of images loaded
    this.rolled = false;  // flag to test if a dice roll is in progress
    this.numRolls = 3;    // track dice rolls left
};
</pre></div> 
    
<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>Modify the <strong>rollDice</strong> method so that it incorporates the following behavior:</p>
        <ul id="csList2">
            <li><p>The variable numRolls is decreased by one each dice roll.</p></li>
            <li><p>The value of numRolls is displayed in the div with id "rolls".</p></li>
            <li><p>The dice can only be rolled if the value of numRolls is greater than 0.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Programming Note:</strong> When referring to the field numRolls in the rollDice method 
            preference the variable and method
            names with the word <strong>that</strong> instead of this. (For example: that.numRolls--;).
           The that variable is assigned the object referenced by the this variable at the top of the 
           rollDice method. This was done to get around some of the problems associated with using the
           this variable.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Implement the method <strong>endTurn</strong>. Method endTurn should do the following
           only if the value of numRolls is equal to 0.</p>
        <ul id="csList2">
            <li><p>Change each die objects hold field to true.
            <li><p>Change the background color of all 5 of the hold buttons to "gold".</p></li>
            <li><p>Disable all 5 of the hold buttons and the "Roll Dice" button. A method named 
                    <strong>disableButtons</strong> has been provided for this purpose.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Programming Note:</strong> The endTurn method is passed a reference to the
            yahtzee object stored in the parameter <strong>obj</strong>. When referencing any of the yahtzee
            fields or methods use this variable. (For example: obj.numRolls).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Programming Note:</strong> A call to the endTurn method has already been added to the rollDice
            method. It is called after the completion of each dice roll.
    </li>
    <li><p>Implement the method <strong>resetTurn</strong>. The resetTurn method is called when the
           button "Rest Turn" has been selected. Method resetTurn should do the following:</p>
        <ul id="csList2">
            <li><p>Reset the numRolls variable back to 3.</p></li>
            <li><p>Change each die objects hold field to false.
            <li><p>Change the background color of all 5 of the hold buttons to "lightgoldenrodyellow".</p></li>
            <li><p>Enable all 5 of the hold buttons and the "Roll Dice" button. A method named 
                    <strong>enableButtons</strong> has been provided for this purpose.</p></li>
            <li><p>Make a call to the method <strong>hideDice</strong>. This method clears the dice
                   images from the dice panel.</p></li>

        </ul>
    
    </li>
</ol>
