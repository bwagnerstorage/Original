<h1>Yahtzee</h1>
<p>Yahtzee is a dice game introduced by Milton Bradley in the 1940's. The goal of Yahtzee is to get as many points as 
   possible by rolling combinations of five dice. You can roll up to three times, possibly choosing to
   just roll some of the dice each time. After you roll, you choose which slot to use based on the
   combination rolled. Different combinations of dice earn points differently. If you don't meet the 
   requirements for the combination you choose, you will get zero points for that slot. The game ends
   when you have filled in all the slots in the game.</p>

<p>We are going to make an electronic version of this game using html, css, and javascript.</p>

<p>In the previous lesson we used an <strong>animation loop</strong> to animate black squares
   by continually moving them up and down a canvas window. An animation loop is designed to 
   execute the entire time a program is running. However, sometimes you only want an animation
   to last for a fixed amount of time. For example, in our Yahtzee game
   we would like to simulate a player rolling dice. This can be accomplished by continually flipping the 
   images that represent the six sides of a die for a fixed amount of time, say two seconds.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<h3>Yahtzee Object</h3>
<p>Look at the following code:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
function yahtzee() 
{
    this.context = null;  // reference to canvas context
    this.dice = [];       // array representing 5 dice
    this.images = [];     // array to store 6 die images
    this.loadCount = 0;   // count of number of images loaded
    this.rolled = false;  // flag to test if a dice roll is in progress
};
</pre></div>
<p>This code defines a <strong>yahtzee object</strong>. Notice there are two arrays. The first array is responsible for storing
   5 die objects and the other stores 6 die images representing a 6 sided die. As a reminder anytime you
   wish to refer to a variable or method that belongs to an object you must 
   preference them with the keyword <strong>this</strong>.</p>
<h3>Preload Images</h3>
<p>When making a game it is often beneficial to preload the game's images prior to
    beginning the game. Look at the following <strong>loadImages</strong> method.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
yahtzee.prototype.loadImages = function() {
    for(var i=0; i < 6; i++)
    {
        var img = new Image();         // create image object
        (function(that, image, j) {
        image.onload = function()      // called when an image is loaded
        {
            that.images[j] = image;
            that.loadCount++;
            if(that.loadCount === 6)   // all images have been loaded
                that.buildDice();      // start game
        };
    })(this, img, i);  // closure
    var filename = "images/d"+ (i+1) + ".png";  // build filenames
    img.src = filename;                // assign filename to image object
    }   
};
</pre></div>
<p>Javascript loads images asynchronously. This means that the program does not stop or block
   until the images are loaded, instead it continues to execute the rest of the program's code. 
   It does, however, notify a program when an image is finished loading by calling the image 
   object's <strong>onload</strong> method.</p>
<p>This asynchronous behavior promotes a problem. We do not want to start our game until all of
    the images have been loaded. To prevent the game code from executing to early I have included a variable
    named <strong>loadCount</strong> that tracks how many images have been loaded. 
    When loadCount equals 6 I know that all the images
    have been loaded so I can start the game by calling the method <strong>buildDice</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p>The rolling dice is the center-piece of our game. To make the
    game more dynamic we would like the dice to be animated. The following method, <strong>rollDice</strong>, is responsible
   for implementing this behavior.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
yahtzee.prototype.rollDice = function()
{   
    if(!this.rolled) 
    {
        var that = this;  // store current this object
        var current = new Date();  // current time in millis
        var rollTime = current.getTime() + 2000;  // current time + 2 seconds
        
        that.rolled = true;  // started roll sequence

        // spin dice images every 1/10 of a second for 2 seconds
        var timer = setInterval(function(){ spinDice(); }, 100); 

        // inner function
        function spinDice() 
        {
            for(var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
            {
                if(that.dice[i].hold === false)
                {
                    var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
                    that.dice[i].value = index;
                }
            }

            that.draw();  // draw dice

            if(new Date().getTime() &gt; rollTime)  // ?Is time up?
            {
                that.rolled = false;   // prevents 2 rolls from occurring at same time
                clearInterval(timer);  // stop animation
            }
        }
    }
    
};
</pre></div>
<p>This code creates a fixed time animation that lasts a total of 2 seconds. To accomplish this
   the code starts by creating a new Date object which stores the current time in milliseconds.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width: 650px"><pre>
var current = new Date();  // current time in milliseconds    
</pre></div>
<p>Then a variable is created named rollTime that stores the current time plus 2 seconds. This variable marks the end of the animation time interval.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width: 650px"><pre>
var rollTime = current.getTime() + 2000;  // current time + 2 seconds  (2000 millis = 2 seconds) 
</pre></div>
<p>An if statement within the method continually checks to see if the current time is
   greater than rollTime. When the if statement becomes true the 2 second interval is up and the
   animation is stopped by calling the <strong>clearInterval</strong> method.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width: 650px"><pre>
if(new Date().getTime() &gt; rollTime)  // Is time up?
{
    that.rolled = false;   // prevents 2 rolls from occurring at same time
    clearInterval(timer);  // stop animation
}  
</pre></div>
<p>The <strong>spinDice</strong> method is responsible for animating the dice by continually
    flipping the die images. It is called
    by the <strong>setInterval</strong> method every 1/10 of a second. The spinDice method
   is what is called an inner function. An inner function is a function that is defined within another
   function. The benefit of an inner function is that it has access to all the variables created in
   its parent function. Inner functions can be named, like spinDice, or they can be created as an anonymous function.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width: 650px"><pre>
// spin dice images every 1/10 of a second for 2 seconds
var timer = setInterval(function(){ spinDice(); }, 100); 

// inner function
function spinDice() 
{
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    {
        if(that.dice[i].hold === false)
        {
            var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
            that.dice[i].value = index;
        }
    }

    that.draw();  // draw dice

    if(new Date().getTime() > rollTime)  // can't roll while rolling
    {
        that.rolled = false;
        clearInterval(timer);  // stop spinning after 2 seconds
    }
}
</pre></div>
<p>The spinDice method assigns a random image to each of the 5 dice, draws the dice on the 
    canvas, and repeats this process every 1/10 second until the 2 second time interval is up.
    The function <strong>clearInterval</strong> is responsible for stopping the animation by
    stopping the time interval created by <strong>setInterval</strong>.</p>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<h3>Die Object</h3>
<p>A die object stores information about a die. The buildDice method creates 5 die objects and adds them to the dice array.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
yahtzee.prototype.buildDice = function() {
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    {
        var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
        this.dice[i] = {value : i, hold : false};    // create die object
    }
};</pre></div>
<p>A die object consists of two fields: <strong>value</strong> and <strong>hold</strong>. The value field stores the face value(1-6) of a
   die. The hold field stores a boolean value that determines whether the die's value field is 
   locked. When a die object's hold field is set to true it is locked which means it's value field cannot
   be changed.</p>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>In the index.html file the following HTML creates 5 button elements.</p>
        <div id='csOutput'><pre>
&lt;div id="holdPanel"&gt;
&lt;button id="hold0" onclick="yahtzee.holdDice(0)"&gt;Hold&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="hold1" onclick="yahtzee.holdDice(1)"&gt;Hold&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="hold2" onclick="yahtzee.holdDice(2)"&gt;Hold&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="hold3" onclick="yahtzee.holdDice(3)"&gt;Hold&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="hold4" onclick="yahtzee.holdDice(4)"&gt;Hold&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>There is one button for each of the five die objects in the dice array.
       The purpose of the hold buttons are to allow a player to hold or lock one or more die so that
       they are not changed during the next roll. When a hold button is clicked the yahtzee method
       holdDice is called with a number parameter that represents the die object that it
       represents. For example, "yahtzee.holdDice(0)" has a parameter of 0 therefore it refers to 
       the first die object in the <strong>dice</strong> array.
    </p>
    <p>Implement the method <strong>holdDice</strong>. The holdDice method toggles a die objects
       current hold status by setting its hold field to either true or false. If the hold field is
       true it is changed to false and if it is false it is changed it to true. When a die object's hold
       field is set to true its value field is locked and cannot be changed.</p>
    <p>The holdDice method also toggles the background color of the hold button that's id corresponds
        to the number given by the parameter <strong>dieNumber</strong>. If die object's hold field is set to true then
       its corresponding hold button's background color is set to "gold". If the die object's hold field
       is set to false then its corresponding hold button's background color is set to "lightgoldenrodyellow".</p>
	   <br>
    </li>
    <li><p>Modify the rollDice method's inner function <strong>spinDice</strong> so that if a die object's
        hold field is set to false its value field remains unchanged.</p></li>
</ol>
