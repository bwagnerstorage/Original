<h3>Game Totals</h3>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is to calculate the total scores for the game. To help with these calculates four new fields
   have been added to the yahtzee object: gameCount, upperCount, yahtzeeCount, and yahtzeeBonus.</p>

<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
function yahtzee() {
    this.context = null;
    this.dice = [];
    this.images = [];
    this.loadCount = 0;
    this.rolled = false;
    this.numRolls = 3;
    this.gameCount = 0;
    this.upperCount = 0;
    this.yahtzeeCount = -1;
    this.yahtzeeBonus = 0;
};
</pre></div> 
<p><strong>gameCount</strong> - a yahtzee game consists of 13 rounds or turns. This variable tracks how
   many rounds have occurred. When gameCount reaches 13 the game is over and the totals are calculated and displayed.</p>
<p><strong>upperCount</strong> - the upper section of the scoreboard has 6 sections. When the player has selected
   all 6 sections the total score for the upper section, including the bonus section, can be calculated and
   displayed in the designated divs. This variable tracks how many sections of the upper section have been
   selected. When upperCount reaches 6 the upper section is complete so the totals are calculated and displayed.</p>
<p><strong>yahtzeeCount</strong> - this variable tracks how many yahtzees the player has rolled. A player is awarded a 100 
   bonus points for each extra yahtzee. The variable is assigned a value of -1 because a player is not
   awarded a bonus till the second yahtzee rolled.</p>
<p><strong>yahtzeeBonus</strong> - stores the total bonus points awarded for multiple yahtzees.</p>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>Implement the method <strong>calculateUpperTotals</strong>. Method calculateUpperTotals calculates
           the total scores for the upper section of the scoreboard, including the bonus section if
           applicable, and displays them in the following divs:
           upperScore, upperBonus, upperTotal, and upperTotal2. upperTotal2 is the upper sections total
           score displayed again in the lower section.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implement the method <strong>calculateLowerTotals</strong>. Method calculateLowerTotals calculates
           the total score for the lower section of the scoreboard and the games final score which
           is the sum of the upper section and the lower section. The calculation for the lower section includes
           yahtzee bonus points earned for any extra yahtzees. The totals are displayed in the following divs:
           lowerTotal and grandTotal.</p></li>
    <li><p>Modify the game so that the variables <strong>gameCount</strong> and <strong>upperCount</strong> are utilized as described above.</p></li>
    <li><p>Modify the game so that the variables <strong>yahtzeeCount</strong> and 
            <strong>yahtzeeBonus</strong> are utilized as described above.</p></li>
    <li><p>In the index html file remove the code that displays the "Reset Turn" button. Then modify the
           game so that when a player clicks on one of the "click" buttons the <strong>resetTurn</strong> method
           is called.</p></li>
