<h3>Google Drive File Stream</h3>
<p>The <strong>Google Drive File Stream</strong> app is a program that can be installed on a computer
   to provide users access to their Google Drive accounts without the need of a browser. The
   app assigns a drive letter to users Google Drive so they can use a computer's file
   system (i.e Window's Explorer) to access the files and folders in their Google Drive.</p>
<p>To begin using Google Drive File Stream let's first determine if the app is installed on 
   your computer. Click on the Start button and scroll the list of apps until you reach the letter D.</p>
