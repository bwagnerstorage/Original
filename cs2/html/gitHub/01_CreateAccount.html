<h1>What is GitHub</h1>
<p>To understand what GitHub is you first have know what a <strong>Git</strong> is. A <strong>Git</strong> is a version control system to keep track of changes to files and projects over time. If you use a git it will allow you to make changes to a file but still keep previous versions of the file in case you want/need to revert back to one. It works like undo and redo in an editor, but it does it for entire files.</p>
<p>Now what is GitHub? GitHub is a website that hosts Git <strong>repositories</strong> online, allowing software developers to store their programming projects on the cloud with version control(Git). GitHub also makes it  
   easier for developers to share their code with other developers. Founded in 2008, GitHub is by far the largest website of its kind. It is currently owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>This begs the question what is a <strong>repository</strong>? A repository or "repos" are folders which contain snapshots or previous versions of the files in the folder. These repos are intentional made by developers so that when they are working on a project, if they make changes to a file or files in that project they can be uploaded or "committed" to GitHub so that GitHub can track those changes.</p>

<p>That was a very brief description of GitHub. To be honest, it's a lot easier for someone to understand what GitHub can do through demonstration. So let's create your own GitHub account so you can see what GitHub can do.</p>
<h1>Create Free GitHub Account</h1>
<ul id="csList">
   <li><p>Click on the following link that will take you to the <a href="https:\\github.com"
      style="color:blue" target="_blank">GitHub website</a>. </p></li>
   <li><p>Select the "Sign Up" button.(Signing up is free!)</p></li>
   <li><p>A page entitled "Create your account" should appear. This page contains three fields that you must fill out in order to create an account. (If possible) For the UserName use your school ID, for the Email Address use your school email, and for your Password use your school password.</p></li>
   <li><p>Click the blue Verify button and follow the instructions.</p></li>
   <li><p>Click the Create Account button.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>GitHub Image Repository</h1>
<p>You can upload any file type to a GitHub repository. This includes image files. The reason that I had you create a GitHub account so early in this course is because we are going to use the fact that GitHub can store images to our advantage. One of the disadvantages of using online editors for free is they typically do not allow you to upload any files to your projects or pens. This creates a problem in that in order to be able to display images in a web page the page needs access to the image file. In the next section, I'm going to walk you through the steps used to upload a file to a repository, in this case an image file.</p>

<h1>Uploading Image Files to a GitHub Repository</h1>
<ol id="csList">
   <li><p>Go to the <a href="https:\\github.com" style="color:blue" target=_blank >GitHub website</a>.</p>
   <li><p>Click on the "Sign in" button in top right corner of the window. When the Sign in window appears sign in to your account using the information you provided when you signed up.</p></li>
   <li><p>If you signed in correctly, your accounts startup page will appear. On the left side of the page next to the label named "Repositories" you will see a green button labelled "New". Click that button.</p></li>
   <li><p>The next page entitled "Create a new repository" has a text field labelled "Repository name". In this box, type the word "images".</p></li>
   <li><p>Now scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the green button labelled "Create repository". You have just created your first GitHub repository named "images".</p></li>
   <li><p>The next page that appears has a lot of stuff on it and can be a little overwhelming, but we are only concerned with one thing. If you look at the section entitled "Quick setup" you will see a link labelled "upload an existing file". Click on that link.</p></li>
   <li><p>Let's stop on this screen for a minute, because we first need to get the image we want to upload.</p></li>
   <li><p>Below is an image of the Earth. If an assignment in this course uses an image file I will typically display the image on the page to that you can download it to your computer so that we can turn around and upload it to GitHub</p></li>
