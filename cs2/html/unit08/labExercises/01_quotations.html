<h3>Short Quotes</h3>
<p>Benjamin Franklin wrote, Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security
will deserve neither and lose both.</p>
<p>Walt Disney once said, The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</p>
<p>Martiun Luther King, Jr. said, The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in
   moments of comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.</p>
<h3>Long Quote</h3>
<p>In a speech at the dedication ceremony for the cemetery at Gettsyburg Abraham Lincoln addressed the crowd with these words:<br>
<br>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
conceived and dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who
here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.</p>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow --
this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far
above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what
we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather,
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a
new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
