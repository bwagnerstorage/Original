<p>It is often necessary in our Java programs to perform some type of mathematical calculation.
  Java provides a <strong>Math</strong> class that contains many methods that can perform these operations.
  To access these methods within a program you would use code like the following</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(16);
int minimum = Math.min(10, 20);
int maximum = Math.max(10, 20);
int absoluteValue = Math.abs(-25);
</pre></div> 

<p>If you have used the Math class before you may have wondered why the Math class name is used
  when referencing one of its methods.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
double squareRoot = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>Math</pre></div>.sqrt(16);
</pre></div> 
 
<p>Instead of the more standard way, which is to create an object and use the object name to access
   the methods.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
Math m = new Math();                 // instantiate Math object
double squareRoot = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>m</pre></div>.sqrt(16);      // use object name to access methods
</pre></div>
<p>The reason the Math class name is used to activate its methods is because the Math class declares
  all of its methods to be <strong>static</strong>. In fact, because of the way the Math class is
  designed if you attempted to create a Math object you would get a compiling error.</p>

<h1>Static Methods</h1>
<p>A <strong>static method</strong> is a method that belongs to a class rather than an object of a class. In fact,
  static methods are often referred to as <strong>class methods</strong>. A static method is created by adding the
  keyword static to a method's header after the access modifier. Look at the header for the Math
  class's sqrt method.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public <div id="csHighlight"><pre>static</pre></div> double sqrt(double a)
</pre></div> 

<p>The sqrt method is static therefore to access it you use the Math class name instead of an object.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
System.out.println(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>Math</pre></div>.sqrt(16));
</pre></div>  

<p>Since an object is not required to call a static method, a static method cannot make reference to 
   instance variables within its body. The following example would cause a compiling error.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class myClass
{
   private int num;      // instance variable

   public static void myMethod()
   {
      System.out.println(num);   // <div id="csHighlight"><pre>error</pre></div>, instance variables are 
                                 // not allowed here
   }
}
</pre></div>  

<p>An instance method is a method that is not static. Instance methods cannot be called from within
   a static method. A common mistake beginning programmers make is to make a call to an instance
   method from within a Java program's main method. The following example would also cause a compiling
   error.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class myClass
{
   public void print()    // instance method
   {
      System.out.println("Hello");
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       print();    // <div id="csHighlight"><pre>error</pre></div>, instance methods cannot be called
                   // by static methods.
   }
}
</pre></div>  

<p>However, if the print method was declared static the code would execute without error.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class myClass
{
   public static void print()   // static (class) method
   {
      System.out.println("Hello");
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       print();    // calls print method
   }
}
</pre></div>  

<p>Futhermore, since the print method is declared static it can be called from within another class
   without the need for an object. To do this simply use dot notation including the class name where
   the method was defined, a dot, then the method name with parameter list.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class myClass
{
   public static void print()   // static (class) method
   {
      System.out.println("Hello");
   }
}

public class myOtherClass
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       myClass.print();    // calls print method using class name
   }

}
</pre></div>
