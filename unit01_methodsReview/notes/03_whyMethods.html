<h1>Why Write Methods?</h1>
<p>There are two main reasons for defining methods within a class.</p>
<div id="csList">
<ol>
<li>Methods are commonly used to break a problem down into small manageable pieces. This is called 
    <strong>method decomposition</strong>.
<li>Methods simplify programs. If a specific task is performed in several places in the program,
    a method can be written once to perform that task, and then be executed anytime it is needed.
    This is known as <strong>code reuse</strong>.</p>
</ol></div>
<h1>Method Decomposition</h1>
<p>To demonstrate method decomposition I have two versions of a program that calculates a student's
   semester average. In the first version all of the code is contained within one method and does not utilize
   method decomposition. The second version breaks the program up into three methods using method decomposition.</p>

<h3>Version 1 - no Method Decomposition</h3>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SemesterAvg
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int s1 = 0;
        int s2 = 0;
        int s3 = 0;
        int exam = 0;
        double semesterAvg = 0;

        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get Grades

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s1 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s2 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s3 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Semester Exam -->");
        exam = keyboard.nextInt();

        // Calculate Semester Average
        // Six Weeks Grades = 80%, Semester Exam 20%

        semesterAvg = (int)Math.round((s1 + s2 + s3)/3 * .8 + exam * .2);

        // Print Semester Average

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Semester Average = " + semesterAvg);
        System.out.println();
    }
}
</pre></div> 

<h3>Version 2 - with Method Decomposition</h3>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SemesterAvg
{
    private int s1;
    private int s2;
    private int s3;
    private int exam;
    private int semesterAvg;

    public void getGrades()
    {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s1 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s2 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s3 = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter Semester Exam -->");
        exam = keyboard.nextInt();
    }

    public void calcSemesterAvg()
    {
        // Six Weeks Grades = 80%, Semester Exam 20%
        semesterAvg = (int)Math.round((s1 + s2 + s3)/3 * .8 + exam * .2);
    }

    public void printSemesterAvg()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Semester Average = " + semesterAvg);
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SemesterAvg app = new SemesterAvg();

        app.getGrades();          // call getGrades
        app.calcSemesterAvg();    // call calcSemesterAvg
        app.printSemesterAvg();   // call printSemesterAvg
    }
}
</pre></div> 

<p>Notice that version 2 contains three additional methods: getGrades, calcSemesterAvg, and 
   printSemesterAvg. Each method has a specific task. By using method decomposition
   the program becomes more manageable and easier to follow. This was a simple example, as problems
   increase in complexity this approach becomes even more valuable.</p>

<h1>Code Reuse</h1>
<p>Look again at the getGrades method from version 2.</p> 
<div id="csCode"><pre>
public void getGrades()
{
    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
    s1 = keyboard.nextInt();

    System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
    s2 = keyboard.nextInt();

    System.out.print("Enter Six Weeks Avg -->");
    s3 = keyboard.nextInt();

    System.out.print("Enter Semester Exam -->");
    exam = keyboard.nextInt();
}
</pre></div> 
 
<p>Notice the similarity of the code and how it is repeated multiple times. To demonstrate code
   reuse I am going to modify the getGrades method by making use of another method named input.
   This method will contain the code that was being repeated in getGrades.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SemesterAvg
{
    private int s1;
    private int s2;
    private int s3;
    private int exam;
    private int semesterAvg;

    public void getGrades()
    {
        s1 = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>input</pre></div> ("Enter 1st Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s2 = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>input</pre></div> ("Enter 2nd Six Weeks Avg -->");
        s3 = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>input</pre></div> ("Enter 3rd Six Weeks Avg -->");
        exam = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>input</pre></div> ("Enter Semester Exam -->");
    }

    public int input(String prompt)
    {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print(prompt);
        return keyboard.nextInt();
    }

    public void calcSemesterAvg()
    {
        // Six Weeks Grades = 80%, Semester Exam 20%
        semesterAvg = (int)Math.round((s1 + s2 + s3)/3 * .8 + exam * .2);
    }

    public void printSemesterAvg()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Semester Average = " + semesterAvg);
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SemesterAvg app = new SemesterAvg();

        app.getGrades();          // call getGrades
        app.calcSemesterAvg();    // call calcSemesterAvg
        app.printSemesterAvg();   // call printSemesterAvg
    }
}
</pre></div>  

<p>The method input actually reads the data from the user and passes it on to getGrades. The code
   reuse occurs when the input method is called four times by getGrades.</p>
<p>Again this was a simple example but hopefully you can see the benefit of code reuse. When you 
   have the same code being repeated multiple times within a program you can create a method and
   place the repeating code in that method. Then the code can be executed anytime it is needed simply
   by calling the method.</p>
