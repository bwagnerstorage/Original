<h1>Removing the End of Line Marker (EOLN)</h1>
<p>When users of a program are typing from the keyboard they press the Enter key to signify the end
   of data entry. The Scanner methods nextInt, nextDouble, and next will read the data from the
   keyboard but they do not remove the end of line marker (EOLN) left when the Enter key was pressed
   after entering the value or values. Look at the following illustration:</p>
 <p>Suppose a person is prompted to type an integer value from the keyboard and they type the number
    57 and press the Enter key. The 57 and an EOLN marker are then placed in a temporary memory
    location called the input stream buffer. The EOLN is denoted below by the symbol [EOLN].</p>
  <div id="csOutput">
  <pre>
Enter an integer --> 57</pre>
  </div>
  <p>The Input Stream buffer would contain the following characters</p>
  <div style="background-color:#BFDFFF; width:350px; font-size:1.3em; margin:0; padding: 5px">
57[EOLN]
  </div>
  <p>Assume that the code segment below prompted the user to enter the value from the keyboard.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter an integer --> ");
int n = keyboard.nextInt();</pre>
 </div>
 <p>The <strong>nextInt</strong> method will remove the value 57 from the Input Stream buffer and store the value in
    the variable n, but it will not read the EOLN marker. The EOLN marker is left on the Input
    Stream buffer.</p>
<div style="background-color:#BFDFFF; width:350px; font-size:1.3em; margin:0; padding: 5px">
[EOLN]
  </div>
  <p>This scenario can cause a problem in your programs when you follow a <strong>nextInt</strong>, <strong>nextDouble</strong>, or <strong>next</strong> method by a <strong>nextLine</strong> method. 
    Let's look at an example.</p>
 <p>Suppose that a person was prompted to type a person's age followed by their name.</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
  <pre>
Enter your age --> 16
Enter your name --> John</pre>
  </div>
 <p>Here is the code segment used to read the keyboard input.</p>
 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter your age -->");
int age = keyboard.nextInt();                 <font color="#FF00FF">// nextInt</font>
 
System.out.print("Enter your name -->");
String name = keyboard.nextLine();            <font color="#FF00FF">// followed by nextLine</font>

System.out.println("Age = " + age);
System.out.println("Name = " + name);</pre>
 </div>
 <p>A sample run of the program would actually produce the following output</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
 <pre>
Enter your age -->16
Enter your name -->Age = 16
Name =</pre>
 </div>
 <p>As you can see the program does not produce the desired result. The program does not allow
    the user to enter a name because the nextLine method read the EOLN marker left by the
	nextInt method. This caused the nextLine method to terminate early; not allowing the user
	to enter a name.</p>
  <h3>How to Fix Problem</h3>
  <p>To fix this problem we are going to use what is referred to as a <strong>dummy read</strong>.
     Look at the modified version of the code from above.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
System.out.print("Enter your age -->");
int age = keyboard.nextInt(); 

<font color="#FF0000">keyboard.nextLine(); </font>   <font color="#FF00FF">// dummy read</font>

System.out.print("Enter your name -->");
String name = keyboard.nextLine();</pre>
 </div>
 <p>A nextLine statement is inserted into the code between the nextInt statement and the
    nextLine statement. This line of code will remove the EOLN marker left by the nextInt so
	that the second nextLine statement will be able to read the name entered by the
	user.</p>
 <p>The nextLine method of the dummy read is not included in an assignment statement. Since the
    rogue EOLN marker does not serve a purpose there is no need to assign it to a variable.</p>
  <div id="csNote">A <strong>dummy read</strong> is a nextLine statement inserted into code that removes
    an EOLN marker left by the methods next, nextInt, and nextDouble.</div>
