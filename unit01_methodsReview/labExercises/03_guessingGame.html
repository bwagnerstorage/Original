<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Write a program that plays a guessing game using the following rules:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. </li>
<li>The player attempts to guess the number selected by the computer. </li>
<li>If the player's guess is less than the number, the message "Too Low, Try Again." is displayed and the user is prompted to guess again. </li>
<li>If the player's guess is greater than the number, the message "Too High, Try Again." is displayed and the user is prompted to guess again. </li>
<li>If the player guesses the number correctly, the message "You found it in ___ tries." is displayed with the number of times the player had to guess before the number was found. </li>
<li>Play continues until the user guesses the computer's number.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Method Decomposition</h3>
<p>This program can be decomposed into the following methods.</p>

<h3>Implement Methods</h3>
<div id="csList">
  <ol>
     <li>Implement method <strong>generateNumber</strong>. This method generates a random number
	     in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive and stores it in the variable number.</li>
	<li>Implement method <strong>makeGuess</strong>. This method displays a prompt asking user to
	    make a guess. It reads the guess and stores it in the variable myGuess. It also increments
	    the variable numGuesses by one.</li>
	<li>Implement method <strong>winner</strong>. This method determines whether the player's guess
	    was correct. If myGuess was a match it returns true. If myGuess was less than the number then
	    it displays the message "Too Low, Try Again!" and returns false. If myGuess was greater than 
		the number then it displays the message "Too High, Try Again!" and returns false.</li>
	<li>Implement method <strong>playGame</strong>. Generates the random number then allows the user to 
	    continually guess the random number until it is found. Once the number is found it displays a
	    message indicating how many guesses it took to find the number. Use methods <strong>generateNumber</strong>,
		<strong>makeGuess</strong>, and <strong>winner</strong> in your implementation.</li>
