<h1>Greenfoot Review</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you are going to review some of the main aspects of making a game
   that you have learned while using Greenfoot.</p>
<br>
<h3>Exercise 1 - Adding objects to a world</h3>
<p>There are three ways to add objects to a world. Two of them involve creating objects within the
  Greenfoot environment by right-clicking on class's icon and selecting its constructor. However, these
   two methods are temporary and you have to keep adding the objects to the world. A more permanent method
   is to add code to the myWorld constructor.</p>
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Add the following code to the MyWorld constructor that creates a Turtle object and adds it to the world at location (50, 50).</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>Turtle sam = new Turtle();
addObject(sam, 50, 50);</pre></div>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add code to the MyWorld constructor that creates a Lobster object named <strong>larry</strong> and adds it to the world at location (50, 350).</p></li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Exercise 2 - move() and turn()</h3>
<p>To move an actor within it's world you first used the 
   <strong>move</strong> and <strong>turn</strong> methods. The move method moves an actor in its
   current direction or heading. The default direction or heading is 0 degrees. 
   In Greenfoot, O degrees is located on the right edge of the world (East). The direction can be changed using the turn method.
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Add the following code to the Turtle class's act method so that it rotates sam the Turtle <strong>clockwise</strong> 1 degree each game cycle.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>turn(1);  // turn clockwise 1 degree</pre></div>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add code to the Lobster class's act method so that it rotates larry the Lobster <strong>counter-clockwise</strong> 1 degree each game cycle.</p></li>
  <li>Remove the turn methods added to the Turtle and Lobster classes.
  <li><p>Add the following code to the Turtle class's act method so that it moves sam the Turtle across the world at a rate of one pixel per game cycle until
  he reaches the eastern or right boundary of the world.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>move(1);  // move 1 pixel in current direction</pre></div>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add code to the Lobster class's act method that will move larry the Lobster across the world at a rate of <strong>two</strong> pixels per game cycle until he reaches eastern boundary.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add the following code to the Turtle class's act method that turns sam the Turtle 180 degrees every time he 
         reaches a world boundary.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>
if(this.isAtEdge())
    turn(180);</pre></div>       
  </li>
   <li><p>Add code to the Lobster class's act method so that larry the Loster turns 180 degrees every time he 
         reaches a world boundary so that he will continue to move, but in the opposite direction.</p></li>
   <li><p>Include code that will <strong>stop</strong> larry from moving after he
         travels back and forth across the world 3 times.</p></li>
  <li><p>Modify the code in the Lobster class's act method so that larry turns <strong>90</strong> degrees instead of 180.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong>If you just do turn(90), then larry will still turn 180 degrees.
       The reason this occurs is because after he turns 90 degrees larry will still be on the boundary edge, therefore the
       if statement will be true for two game cycles or two calls to the act method.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <h3>Exercise 3 - Collision Detection</h3>
  <p>Greenfoot provides several methods for detecting Actor collisions. The method we used the
     most was the Actor class's <strong>isTouching</strong> method. The isTouching method returns true
     if the actor that made the call to isTouching collided with another actor.</p>
  <ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Add the following code to the MyWorld constructor.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>House house1 = new House();
House house2 = new House();
addObject(house1, 150, 150);
addObject(house2, 450, 150);
        
WalkingMan bob = new WalkingMan();
addObject(bob, 300, 150);</pre></div>
</li>
  <li><p>Add the following code to WalkingMan class's act method so that when the man collides with
        a house he changes his direction and continues to move, but in the opposite direction.</p></li> 
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>move(1);
if(isTouching(House.class))
{
    turn(180); 
}</pre></div>
<p>Add the following line of code to the WalkingMan's act method so that his image is not upside down when
   he changes direction.</p>
    <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>getImage().mirrorVertically();</pre></div>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Exercise 4 - setLocation(), getX(), getY()</h3>
  <p>The second technique used to move actors is the <strong>setLocation</strong> method.
     Given the x and y coordinates of a location within the world the setLocation method 
     will move the actor to this location.</p>
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Add the following code to the MyWorld constructor.</p>
  <div id="csCode"><pre>Ambulance amber = new Ambulance();
addObject(amber, 150, 250);</pre></div>
</li>
  
  <li><p>Add the following code to amber the Ambulance's act method.</p>
    <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>setLocation(450, 250);</pre></div>
  </li> 
  <li><p>Replace the setLocation method in amber's act method with the following code.</p> 
     <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>setLocation(getX() + 1, getY());</pre></div>
     <p>The getX() and getY() methods return the (x,y) location of an object. They can be used with
        the setLocation method to move objects relative to their current location. This code is basically saying, "Get my current x coordinate 
        and increase it by one, then get my current y coordinate and leave it the same. Now move me
        to this location."<p>
  </li> 
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Exercise 5 - Keyboard Input</h3>
  <p>Greenfoot provides methods for both keyboard and mouse input. These methods are defined in a
     special class named <strong>Greenfoot</strong>. This class is special because the input methods
     are called directly by the Greenfoot class without the need of a Greenfoot object.</p>
     <p>The methods <strong>isKeyDown</strong> and <strong>getKey</strong> are demonstrated below.</p>
    <div id="csCode"><pre>if(Greenfoot.isKeyDown("left"))  // Is the "left" key being pressed?
{
    // code not shown
}

String key = Greenfoot.getKey();  // get last key that was pressed and released
if("up".equals(key))              // Was that key equal to "up" key?
{
    // code not shown
}</pre></div>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Replace the code in amber the Ambulance's act method with the following code.</p></li>
<div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>if(Greenfoot.isKeyDown("left"))
{
    setLocation(getX() - 1, getY());
    setRotation(180);  // west
}

else if(Greenfoot.isKeyDown("right"))
{
    setLocation(getX() + 1, getY());
    setRotation(0);    // east
}
</pre></div>
<p>The setRotation method in this code turns amber so that she is facing in the direction specified.
   (East = 0, West = 180, South = 90, North = 270)</p>
<li><p>Add code to amber's act method so that she can move up and down. The ambulance needs to rotated
       so that amber is facing the direction she is going.</p></li>
</ol>

  <h3>Exercise 6 - Mouse Input</h3>
  <ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Add the following code to the House class's act method.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>if(Greenfoot.mouseClicked(this))    // "this" means this house
  {
      spinAmount = 360;
  }
      
  if(spinAmount > 0)
  {
      setRotation(getRotation() + 1);  // add 1 to current rotation angle
      spinAmount--;
  }</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Modify the code above so that a House object will spin 5 times faster and does 5 more complete circles. </p></li>

</ol>
