<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>When teachers retire in Texas they are eligible to receive an annuity. An annuity is a fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, typically for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>Teachers are eligible to retire when the number of years they have taught and their age at retirement add up to at least 80. For example, this is Mrs. Sloan's 30th year to teach high school, but she would like to retire at the end of this school year so she can work at a pet adoption clinic. She will be 55 years of age at the end of this school year. Mrs. Sloan is eligible to retire because her years of service plus her age is greater than or equal to 80. This is often referred to as the "Rule of 80".</p>
<p>The amount of a teacher's yearly annuity is determined by the following formula:</p>
<h3>Years of Serve * 2.3% * Average of 5 Highest Salaries</h3>

<p>Write a program that will calculate a teacher's yearly and monthly annuity given the following inputs:</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Teacher's name</p></li>
  <li><p>Teacher's age at end of school year.</p></li>
  <li><p>Teacher's 5 highest yearly salaries.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The program's output should resemble the sample run below.</p> 
<p>If a teacher meets the requirements for retirement, then the program should display a message notifying them that they are eligible to retire, otherwise the message should inform the teacher that they are not eligible to retire this year and how many years it will be before they can retire. The word "year" should be displayed in either singular or plural form depending upon whether the years to retirement is 1 or greater than 1.
For example, 1 year or 5 years.</p>
The output should also include a summary report that displays the following information: Current yearly and monthly salary, yearly and monthly annuity, and the average of their highest 5 salaries (This will typically be the last 5 years).</p>

<p>When a teacher retires they are eligible to join the state's health insurance program designated for retirees called TRS-Care. However, if the teacher is 65 or over they also qualify for federal health insurance called medicare. If a teacher qualifies for medicare, then it automatically becomes their primary insurance and TRS-Care becomes their secondary insurance. Below the summary report, display a message that informs the teacher which insurance will be there primary.</p>
