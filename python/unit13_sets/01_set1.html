<h1>Python Set</h1>
<p>A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. A set has another useful property, namely it cannot contain duplicate items. If you attempt to add
a duplicate item to a set, it does not give an error message, instead the set will simply ignore the attempt. In this lab, you will be utilizing this property.
</p>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>In this lab, you are going to simulate the machine that chooses the numbered balls used in a lottery. The machine, at random, selects 6 balls with numbers in the range of 1 to 50 inclusive. All of the selected numbers are unique, meaning there are no duplicates. Remember, to use the random module you have to import it.
<p>Write a program that uses a loop and the random module's randInt method to generate 6 random numbers in range of 1 to 50. Store the numbers in a set so there are no duplicate numbers. The program's output should resemble the Sample Run below.</p>
<p>Hint: You will need to create an empty set. To do this use the set constructor.</p>
