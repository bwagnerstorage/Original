<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>This program contains a class named <strong>FarmAnimal</strong>. This class represents
   an animal that lives on a farm. The class defines three attributes or characteristics 
   for the animal. The animal's type (Ex. cow), the animal's names (Ex. Mable), and the 
   sound the animal makes (Ex. moo).</p>
<p>The program also contains two classes named <strong>FoodAnimal</strong> and
   <strong>ServiceAnimal</strong> that enhances the FarmAnimal class by inheriting it's
    attributes and methods, and then adding other attributes and methods.</p>
<p>Copy the starter code below and paste it in your main.py file.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>class FarmAnimal:
  def __init__(self, type, name, sound):
     self.type = type
     self.name = name
     self.sound = sound
  
  def getType(self):
    return self.type

  def getName(self):
    return self.name

  def getSound(self):
    return self.sound

  def print(self):

horse = ServiceAnimal("horse", "Jumper", "neigh", "I take people for rides.")

<h3>FoodAnimal Class</h3>
<p>Complete the class FoodAnimal. The class needs to include the following:</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Complete the FoodAnimal <strong>constructor</strong>. Use super(). to initialize
       the three inherited variables. Also initialize the new variable <strong>food</strong>
       that describes the type of food the animal provides. (Have you heard how someone 
       once compared the 
       difference between involvement and commitment as being like the difference between ham and eggs. 
       "The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.")</p></li>
       <li><p>Complete the method <strong>getFood</strong> that returns the value
       of the variable food.</p></li>
       <li><p>Override the inherited method <strong>print</strong> so that it includes the food 
        that the animal provides for the farm. Use super().print() to include the FarmAnimal's
        print method in the output. Refer to Sample Run for an example of the print methods output 
        structure.
       </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>ServiceAnimal Class</h3>
<p>Complete the class ServiceAnimal. The class needs to include the following:</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Complete the ServiceAnimal <strong>constructor</strong>. Initialize
       the three inherited variables. Also initialize the new variable <strong>service</strong>
       that describes the type of service the animal provides to a farm.</p></li>
       <li><p>Complete the method <strong>getService</strong> that returns the value
       of the variable service.</p></li>
       <li><p>Override the inherited method <strong>print</strong> so that it includes the service 
        that the animal provides for the farm.
       </p></li>
</ol>
