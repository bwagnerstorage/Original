<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>Write a test generator program that includes the following features:</p>
<ul id="csList">
  <li><p>It can create a test consisting of both multiple choice and
      true/false questions.</p></li>
  <li><p>A test can have any number of questions.</p></li>
  <li><p>It utilizes the three classes: <strong>Question</strong>, <strong>MultipleChoice</strong>, and <strong>TrueFalse</strong> 
      from the previous assignment.</p></li>
  <li><p>It includes a class named <strong>Test</strong> that stores a list of questions.</p></li>  
  <li><p>A Test object stores a test's name, subject (Ex. History),
      topic (what the test covers), list of questions, and
      the number of test questions.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>A test can be both saved and opened from a file. It should be 
    able to save more than one test so the program needs to provide the
    ability to select a test that the user would like to open.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>A test can be displayed with all of its metadata clearly labeled, including
     the test's name, subject, and topic. A test's questions should also be displayed
     along with their metadata: type, subject, topic, and correct answer.</p></li>
  <li><p>A test can be displayed in a "test format" which includes the name of the test,
    each question numbered and displayed in either multiple choice or true false format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the program needs to include one of the following features:</p>
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>The ability to edit a test, including its questions, and the 
    ability to delete a test.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>The ability to administer a test where a user can enter answers
     and the test is graded and the user is given a percentage score.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For convenience the Question, MultipleChoice, and TrueFalse classes are included
  below, feel free to use your own versions.
</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>class Question:
  def __init__(self, type, subject, topic):
