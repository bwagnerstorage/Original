<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>This lab contains classes used to develop tests and/or quizzes
  that contain both Multiple Choice and True/False questions. The program
  uses inheritance to create the two types of questions.
</p>
<p>Your assignment is to create two classes named <strong>MultipleChoice</strong>
   and <strong>TrueFalse</strong> that inherit the functionality of a base or parent class named <strong>Question</strong>.
   These two classes contain information needed to create multiple choice and true/false questions.
</p>
<h3>File main.py</h3>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Create a new replit named <strong>inherit2</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the code below into the file main.py.</p></li>
<div id="csCode"><pre>from question import MultipleChoice
from question import TrueFalse
  
q1 = MultipleChoice("MC", "What is the capital of Texas?", "Houston", "Austin","Dallas", "San Antonio", "Austin", "Geography", "Capitals")
  
q2 = MultipleChoice("MC", "Which of the following is not a state that borders Texas?", "Louisiana", "Arkansas", "Arizona", "Oklahoma", "Arizona")
  
q3 = TrueFalse("TF","The longest river in the world is the Mississippi River.", False, "Geography", "Rivers")
  
q4 = TrueFalse("TF", "The Amazon River is the widest river in the world.", True)
  
print(q1.info())
print("1. " + q1.display())
print()
  
print(q2.info())
print("2. " + q2.display())
print()
  
print(q3.info())
print("3. " + q3.display())
print()
 
print(q4.info())
print("4. " + q4.display())
print()
</pre></div>
</ol>
<h3>Question class</h3>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Create another file in the inherit2 replit named <strong>question.py</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the following code into this file.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>class Question:
  def __init__(self, type, subject, topic):
      self.type = type
      self.subject = subject
      self.topic = topic

  def info(self):
    str = "Question Type: " + self.type
    if self.subject != None:
      str += "\nQuestion Subject: " + self.subject 
    if self.topic != None:
      str += "\nQuestion Topic:" + self.topic
    return str;


class MultipleChoice(Question):



class TrueFalse(Question):
  
    

</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>The Question class declares three variables: type, subject, and topic.
  The type variable contains one of two values: "MC" or "TF" which are used to 
  describe the type of question as either a multiple choice or true/false.
  The subject refers to the subject matter of the question (Ex. Geography). The topic refers to the questions topic (Ex. capitals).</p>
  <p>The Question class also contains a constructor and method named info. The info method is used for displaying the type, subject, and topic variables.
  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>MultipleChoice Class</h3>
<p>The MultipleChoice class is a subclass of the Question class. It contains
   information needed to create a multiple choice question. This includes the question, 
   four possible answer choices, and the correct answer.</p>
<p>The class defines a constructor that initializes the Question class's variables, as well as the variables needed to create a multiple choice question.</p>
<p>Look at the following constructor header for the Multiple Choice class:
<div id="csCode"><pre>def __init__(self, type, question, A, B, C, D, answer, subject=None, topic=None):</pre></div>
</p>
<p>Notice the subject and topic parameters are assigned a value of <strong>"None"</strong>. This syntax is used to make these variables optional. This means when you are creating a Multiple Choice question you have the option of assigning or not assigning a value to these variables making them optional.
Any variable you want to declare as optional must be listed at the end of the constructor's parameter list.</p>
<p>Look at the info method declared in the Question class. Because the subject and topic variables are declared as optional in the Multiple Choice and True/False constructors it is necessary to include if statements in the info method that test 
to see if the variables subject and topic are assigned a value of None. This will prevent a null pointer exception error from occurring when displaying question info.</p>
<p>The class also needs to include a new method named <strong>display</strong> that returns a string that formats a
   multiple choice question in the following form:<br><br>
   Question<br>
   A. Choice A<br>
   B. Choice B<br>
   C. Choice C<br>
   D. Choice D<br>
   <br>
</p>

<h3>TrueFalse Class</h3>
<p>The TrueFalse class is a subclass of the Question class. It contains
  information needed to create a True/False question. This includes the question and the
  correct answer which can be either True or False.</p> 
<p>The class defines a constructor that initializes the Question class's variables,
    as well as variables necessary to create a True/False question.</p>
<p>The class also needs to include a new method named <strong>display</strong> that returns a string that formats a
      true/false question in the following form:<br><br>
Question [T/F]<br>
</p>
