<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
Write a program that allows a person to practice their multiplication skills. The program should include the following features:

<ul id="csList"><li><p>Prompts the user to enter the number of multiplication problems they would like to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses a counter-controlled loop that allows the user to do the number of practice problems desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Creates a multiplication problem that includes two operands randomly generated in the range of 0 to 10.</p></li>
<p>Displays the problem number in the following format: "Problem x", where x is the current problem number.</p>
<li><p>On the same line it displays an input prompt that includes the multiplication problem with the following format:<br>
    "operand1 * operand2 = "</p>
<p>Displays the problem number in the following format: "Problem x", where x is the current problem number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allows the user to input their answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Checks to see if the user's answer matches the correct answer. If the user's answer matches, then the program displays the message "Correct!". If the user's answer does not match, then it displays the message "Incorrect. Answer = " along with the the correct answer.</p></li>
<li><p>After answering a question, the program displays how many problems the user has gotten right out of the number of problems attempted.</p></li>
<li><p>When the program reaches the number of problems specified by the user, the program displays the percentage of how many problems they got right.</p></li>
<li><p>Next the program displays a prompt asking the user if they would like to "Go Again (y/n)-->". If the user enters "y", then the program starts over. If the user enters "n" then the message "Good bye is displayed and the program ends. This step requires the use of a sentinel-controlled loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the Sample Run below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programming Note:</strong> This program utilizes both a counter-controlled loop and sentinel-controlled loop. The counter-controlled loop is nested inside of the sentinel-controlled loop.</p>
