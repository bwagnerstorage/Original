<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
Write a program that plays a guessing game using the following rules:

<ul id="csList"><li><p>The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.</p></li>
<li><p>The player attempts to guess the number selected by the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>If the player's guess is less than the number, the message "Too Low, Try Again." is displayed and the user is prompted to guess again. </p></li>
<li><p>If the player's guess is greater than the number, the message "Too High, Try Again." is displayed and the user is prompted to guess again.</p></li>
<li><p>If the player guesses the number correctly, the message "You found it in ___ tries." is displayed with the number of times the player had to guess before the number was found.</p></li>
<li><p>Play continues until the user guesses the computer's number.<br><br> <strong>Hint:</strong> Declare a boolean variable and assign it a value of False. When the player guesses the random number correctly set the variable to True. For example,</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:400px"><pre>winner = False</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="csSampleRun"><pre>
Make Guess->50
Too High, Try Again!
Make Guess->25
Too Low, Try Again!
Make Guess->37
Too Low, Try Again!
Make Guess->44
Too High, Try Again! 
Make Guess->39
Too Low, Try Again!
Make Guess->41

**** You found it in 6 tries.
