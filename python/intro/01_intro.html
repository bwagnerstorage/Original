<h1>Learning Python</h1>
  <p>We will be using the learning site <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" style="color:blue">w3schools.com</a>
     for the majority of our course content. Why use w3schools?</p>
  <ul id="csList">
    <li><p>It's a free site.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's written with the beginner in mind.</p></li>
    <li><p>With their "Try it Yourself" editor, students can 
      edit Python code and view the result in real time on their site.</p></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<ol id="csList">
   <li><p>Go to the <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" style="color:blue">w3schools website</a>. Click on the Tutorial Menu and 
       select <b>Learn Python</b> in the Programming Section.</p></li>
   <li><p>View the first four lessons in the Python Tutorial: <strong>Python Home</strong>,
     <strong>Python Intro</strong>, <strong>Python Get Started</strong>, and 
     <strong>Python Syntax</strong>.</p></li>
   <li><p>Make sure you test out their "Try it Yourself" editor.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Replit</h1>
<p>We will be using the online coding site
 <a href= "https://www.replit.com" target="_blank" style="color:blue">replit.com</a> as our Python IDE or editor. By using this 
    site your code will be available at home as well as at school. We will look at other Python editors later in the course.</p>

<h3>Create a Free Replit Account</h3>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Click on the following link to open replit:
  <a href= "https://www.replit.com" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Start Here!</a></p></li>
  <li><p>Click on the blue "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the window.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use your school id as your <strong>UserName</strong>, your school email for the <strong>Email</strong>, and your school 
      password as your <strong>Password</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click <strong>Create Account</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you were successful in creating your account, you should be looking at
      your home screen. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with this screen.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now see if you can create a new Python repl. (A repl is a page in Replit's online editor). When you create a new repl, Replit proves a name for the repl. Instead of using their made up name give your repl the name <strong>MyFirst</strong>. The Replit IDE opens a new page with three windows positioned horizontally across the screen. The far left window allows you to view the files that have been created by Replit. The middle window is the editor where you type your code. By default Replit creates a file named main.py for the editor.
  The window to the right is the output window and it is where you will see your programs output displayed.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Type the following code in the editor window:  print("My First Program")</p></li>
  <li><p>Press the <strong>Run</strong> button to execute your Python code.</p></li>
  <li><p>Change the phrase in the print function to "Python is fun!" and Run the program  again.</p></li>]
</ol>
<p>This lesson was an introduction to the Python language and the Replit IDE. Get ready for a fun ride as we learn the ins and outs of the Python language.</p>
