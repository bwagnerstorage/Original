<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<p> Data structures, often referred to as collections, are “containers” that organize and group data according to type. 
   The basic data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary.
   Each of these data structures is unique in its own way. Python disguises between them 
   based on their mutability and order. 
   
   <h3>Mutability</h3>
   <p>The Mutability of a data structure 
   refers to whether or not the data stored in the data structure can be changed or modified.
   If a data structure is mutable it means its data can be modified and immutable means the data cannot be modified.
   For example, Python's String class is immutable, therefore once a string is created its 
   characters cannot be changed.</p>

   <h3>Order</h3>
   <p>When we say that a data structure is ordered, it means that its data has a defined order.
   For example, strings are ordered, because their characters are assigned an index. The first character is index zero [0], the 
   second character is index one [1], and so on.</p>
   
   <h1>List</h1>
   <p> Lists are mutable and ordered. A list, as its name implies, is a list of data (integers, floats, strings, Booleans, 
   or even other lists or more complicated data types). Like characters in strings, elements of a list are indexed starting
   at 0 using [ ] syntax.
   </p>

   <h3>Creating a List</h3>
   <p>A List is created using square brackets.</p>
   
   <div id="csCode" style = "width:500px"><pre>numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
colors  = ["red", "white", "blue"]
temps   = [98.6, 99.5, 101.8]
emptyList = []
   </pre></div>

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Use square brackets[ ] to create a list named <strong>myList1</strong> that contains the following numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.</p></li>
<li><p>Display myList1.</p></li>
<li><p>Display the numbers at index 1 and index 3.</p></li> 
<li><p>Use the index operator[] to change the value 30 to 3000.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the len function to display the length of myList1.</p></li>
<li><p>Display myList1.</p></li>
<li><p>Use square brackets[] to create a list named <strong>myList2</strong> that contains the following strings: "North", "NorthEast", "East", "SouthEast", "South",
                       "SouthWest", "West", "NorthWest".
</p></li>
<li><p>Display blank line.</p></li>
<li><p>Display myList2.</p></li>
<li><p>Use range syntax [start:end-1] to display the strings "East", "SouthEast", "South",
   "SouthWest", "West".</p></li>
<li><p>Use range syntax [start:end-1] to display the strings "North", "NorthEast", "East".</p></li>
<li><p>Use range syntax [start:end-1] to display the strings "East", "SouthEast", "South".</p></li></p></li>
<li><p>Use range notation [start:end-1] to change "North" to "NORTH".</p></li>
<li><p>Use range notation [start:end-1] to change "SouthEast","South","SouthWest" to "SE", "S", "SW" respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Display myList2</p></li>
