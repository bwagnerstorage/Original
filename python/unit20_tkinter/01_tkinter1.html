<h1>Tkinter</h1>
<p>Tkinter is the defacto GUI library for Python. If you want a quick and easy way to write GUI programs in Python then Tkinter is probably your best choice. There are a multitude of resources to help you get started including online tutorials and videos.  



<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>In the previous unit you made a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. In this assignment, your task is to convert this program into a graphical program so that the tic-tac-toe grid is drawn on a GUI window. Using a Model-View Architecture you should be able to use the logic and data structures (2D Array) from your text-based game to simplify the program's design.</p>
<p>At the top of this page I have listed several Tkinter tutorials that might be useful to you, but there are probably better one's out there.</p>
 
<h3>Tkinter Canvas</h3>
<p>To display a Tic-Tac-Toe grid on a GUI window you will want to use Tkinter's canvas widget. Here is another link that describes how to use a <a href="https://pythonbasics.org/tkinter-canvas/#:~:text=A%20tkinter%20canvas%20can%20be,ovals%2C%20polygons%2C%20and%20rectangles.canvas" style="color:blue; font-size:1.2em" target="_blank">canvas</a>.</p>
