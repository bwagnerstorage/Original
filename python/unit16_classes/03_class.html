<h1>Python Classes</h1>
<p>In this lab you going to complete a class named Fraction. This class should be able to 
   add, subtract, multiply, and divide two fractions. The Fraction class can handle fractions
   that are single or multi-digit and positive or negative. When inputting a fraction problem it
   should be in the following format:  <strong>a/b + c/d</strong>.

<P>The Fraction class includes a method named <strong>reduce</strong> and several other helper methods.
   The reduce method, given a Fraction object, will return a new fraction that is the input
   fraction reduced to it's lowest terms.
</P>
<h3>Fraction Constructor</h3>

<p>Complete the Fraction class's constructor so that it initializes two variables named self.num and self.denom to
   the values of the two variables <strong>num</strong> and <strong>denom</strong> given in the constructor's 
   parameter list. The instance variables self.num and self.denom
   represent the numerator and denominator of a fraction object.
</p>

<h3>Method compute_lcm</h3>
<p>The LCM or Least Common Multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of both the fraction objects.
   The LCM is used in fraction addition and subtraction to determine the LCD or 
   Least Common Denominator of two fractions. To determine the LCM of the two
   fractions follow the steps below.
</p>
<p>To write the method compute_lcm follow these steps.</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Given the two fraction's denominators <strong>d1</strong> and <strong>d2</strong> in compute_lcm's parameter list, use an if statement to determine which one of the denominators
       has the greater value, and store this value in a variable named <strong>greater</strong>.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the variable <strong>greater</strong> is divible by both d1 and d2, then the value of greater is the LCM of the two fractions and should be returned by the method.<br>
 However, if the value of greater is not divisible by both d1 and d2, then greater's value should be incremented by one.
 This process should be repeated until the lcm is found. The method should
 return the lcm.</p></li>

 <div id="csCode"><pre>  def compute_lcm(self, a, b):

  # choose the greater number
  if a > b:
      greater = a
  else:
      greater = b

  # loop until greater is divisible 
  # by both a and b
  found = False
  while(not found):
      if greater % a == 0 and greater % b == 0:
         lcm = greater
         found = True  # exit loop
      else:
         greater += 1
  return lcm</pre>

 </div>
</ol> 
<h3>Method add</h3>
<p>Write the method add. Given a fraction <strong>self</strong> and a second fraction <strong>other</strong>,
   add the two fractions using their LCM (LCD) . Call the method <strong>reduce</strong>, that is provided in the fraction class, to reduce the answer of the addition problem to its lowest terms. Return the answer returned by reduce as a fraction object. In the addition process you will need to adjust the values of the numerators to reflect the changes made to the two fractions denominator.</p>
<p>The add method is invoked with the following code:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>ans = frac1.add(fract2)</pre></div>

<h3>Method subtract</h3>
<p>Write the method subtract. Given a fraction self and a second fraction other,
   subtract the two fractions using their LCM (LCD) . Call the method reduce, that is provided in the fraction class, to reduce the answer of the subtraction problem to its lowest terms. Return the answer returned by reduce as a fraction object. In the subtraction process you will need to adjust the values of the numerators to reflect the changes made to the two fractions denominator.</p>
<p>The subtract method is invoked with the following code:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>ans = frac1.subtract(fract2)</pre></div>

<h3>Method multiply</h3>
<p>Write the method multiply. Given a fraction self and a second fraction other,
   multiply the two fraction and call the reduce method to reduce the answer to its lowest terms, then return the answer as a fraction object.</p>
<p>The multiply method is invoked with the following code:</p> 
<div id="csCode"><pre>ans = frac1.multiply(fract2)</pre></div>

<h3>Method divide</h3>
<p>Write the method divide. Given a fraction self and a second fraction other,
   divide the two fraction and call the reduce method to reduce the answer to its lowest terms, then return the answer as a fraction object.</p>
<p>The multiply method is invoked with the following code:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>ans = frac1.divide(fract2)</pre></div>

<h3>Method get</h3>
<p>Write the method get. This method should return the fraction object self in a printable format: num/denom (example: 7/8).</p>
