   <h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
   <p>You are going to complete the program started below that allows a user to keep track of their friends birthdays.
      The first time the program runs it should create a data file named "birthdays.txt". When the program exits it
      should save the birthday list to a data file with each line of the file consisting of a person's name, a comma, and the
      person's date of birth. When the program is executed again it should read the data file one line at a time creating a record (list) for each line.
      These records should then be added to the birthday list; creating a list of lists, also known as a list of records.</p>
      <p>The program should be able to create new records from keyboard input and add them to the birthday list. The program should also
         be able to view, edit, and remove records from the birthday list.
      </p>

def main():
   readFile()
   menu()
   writeFile()
      
main()
</pre>
         </div>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Notice the main function at the bottom of the code. It calls the readFile function first, followed by the
            menu function, and finally the writeFile function.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>readFile</strong>. This function opens the "birthday.txt" file. If the file
            does not exist the code creates the file. It accomplishes this through the use of a try_except statement shown below:</p>
         <div id="csCode">
            <pre>
   try:
      file = open("birthday.txt", "r") # try to open file for reading
   except:
      file = open("birthday.txt", "w")  # if not successful, then create file "birthday.txt"  
   </pre>
         </div>
         <p>The open function causes a runtime error to occur when the file it is trying to open does not exist. By
            placing the code in a <strong>try</strong> block it prevents the program from crashing, instead the program
            transfers execution to the except block where the open function is called again but instead of being in
            reading mode "r" it is now in writing mode "w". This is important because when the open function is in
            writing mode, if the file does not exist, it will create the file for you. Incidentally, errors that occur
            in computer programs are often referred to as exceptions. That is why it is a try_except statement.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>If the file is open for reading then the function should read the entire file line by line. Each line should contain a string
             consisting of a friend's name and their birthday separated by a comma. Split the string apart storing the person's name 
             in the first cell of a list and the person's birthdate in the second cell of the list, there by creating 
             a record. Add each record to the birthday list.
      </p></li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>writeFile</strong>. This function writes the contents of the birthday list to
            the data file "birthday.txt" with each line of the file consisting of a person's name, followed by a comma, and
            their birth date.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>addRecord</strong>. This function allows a user to add a new record to the
            birthday list. A record consists of the person's name and their birthdate. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>viewRecord</strong>. This function allows a user to view a record by typing in
            a person's name and the function displays the person's name and birth date in the format shown in the sample
            run below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>editRecord</strong>. This function allows a user to edit a record by typing in
            a person's name and the function searches for that record. If it finds the record the function then asks the
            user if they wish to edit the person's name. If the user responds positively then the function prompts the
            user for the new name and replaces it with the old name. This is repeated for the birth date as well.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>removeRecord</strong>. This function allows a user to remove a record by
            typing in a person's name and the function searches for that record. If it finds the record the function
            then asks the user if they really want to remove this record. If the user responds positively then the
            function removes that record from the birthday list, otherwise it just returns to the main menu.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Complete the function <strong>viewList</strong>. This function displays the birthday list with each row
            consisting of the person's name, a space, and the person's birthdate.</p>
      </li>
