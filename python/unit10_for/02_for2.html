<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<p>Write program, that given a list of numbers, will calculate the mean, median, and mode for the numbers. <strong style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: 14px">Mean</strong> is the average of the numbers in the list. <strong style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: 14px">Median</strong> is the number that is the middle of the list when the list is sorted in ascending order and has an odd numbered length. If the list has an even numbered length, then the median is the average of the two numbers that share the middle position in the list. <strong style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: 14px">Mode</strong> is the number or numbers that occur the most often in the list. If all the numbers in the list occur once in the list, then there is no mode value.</p>
<p>The program should give the user the option of generating the list of numbers randomly or through keyboard input. It should also allow the user to specify how many numbers will be in the list and their range of values.</p>
<p>Your program's output should resemble the sample runs below.</p>
<h3>Programming Tips</h3>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p>Use the List class's <strong style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: 14px">sort</strong> method in order to calculate the median and mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Your program should include both the while loop and the for loop in its implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>The mode is the most difficult of the three calculations. It will definitely challenge you. Use two nested while loops to iterate the list in order to find the maximum number of times that the numbers occur in the list. For example, the following list has 2 numbers that are repeated 3 times, therefore the maximum number of<br> times is 3:</p><br>
<p style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: 16px">[1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]</p>
<br>
</li>
<li><p>Use another set of nested while loops to iterate through the list again to find and print all of the numbers that occur in the list the maximum number of times, in the case of the example above, the maximum was 3 times, therefore 2 and 8 are the mode values.
If there is no mode value, because all the numbers only occur once, your program should display "none" for the mode.
