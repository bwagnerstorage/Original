      <p>Suppose myList is a linked list. A loop such as</p>
      <pre>   for (int k = 0; k < myList.size(); k++)
     Object a = myList.get(k);</pre>
      <p>can be inefficient if the get method always starts at the front of the list to locate each element.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>This question describes a variant of a linked list data structure that 
        can improve the efficiency of the loop. The ListNode class is used as 
        part of the implementation of a class MyList that remembers the node and 
        index of the most recently visited element of the list. If the index for 
        the next get is greater than or equal to the remembered index, the traversal 
        starts at the remembered node instead of the front of the list.</p>
      <p>For example, consider the following MyList that contains five 
        elements. The call myList.get(2) returns the value C. The remembered node 
        and remembered index will refer to the node at index 2 as shown in the 
        diagram.</p>
      <p><img src="List1.gif"></p>
      <p>If the call myList.get(2) is executed again, the value C is returned 
        again, but the traversal begins at the remNode position, instead of front, 
        because the remembered index is 2. No other nodes are traversed because 
        remNode is already at the correct position.</p>
      <p>A subsequent call myList.get(4) will start the traversal at the remNode 
        position instead of front because the remembered index is 2. It will then 
        move forward two nodes to retrieve the node at index 4 (the value E), 
        set remNode to the new position, and update remIndex as shown in the following 
        diagram.</p>
      <p><img src="List2.gif"></p>
      <p>Finally, a subsequent call myList.get(3) will start the traversal at 
        front because the remembered index is greater than the desired index. 
        Starting at front, it will move forward three nodes to retrieve the node 
        at index 3 (the value D), set remNode to the new position, and update 
        remIndex as shown in the<br>
        following diagram.</p>
