        <p>Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who,
           according to legend, was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. He is often portrayed as
           "robbing from the rich and giving to the poor" alongside his band of Merry Men.</p>
        <p>In this exam you are going to complete a class named RobinHood that
           uses a 2DArray in its implementation. </p>
        <hr>

        <p>A town is represented in the RobinHood class as a 2D array of
           of houses. Each house contains a family that is either poor or
           wealthy. A family is poor if their wealth is less than or equal
           to 10 and a family is wealthy if their wealth is 
           greater than 10. Look at the following example of a 3 by 3 2D array
           that represents a town. The town consists of 9 houses. The house at location (0,0) 
           contains a value 0f 16. This means the family living there has a 
           wealth of 16 therefore they are considered wealthy. The family at location (0,1)
           has a wealth of 5 therefore they are considered poor.
