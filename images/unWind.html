<p>A <strong>stack</strong> is data structure (memory location) that stores information relating to each method call that is made in a program.</p>

<p>Suppose you have two methods: methodA and methodB. If methodA calls methodB, processing stops in methodA and begins on the first line
   of methodB. When methodB returns, processing resumes in methodA on the first line below the call to methodB.</p>

<p>How does this work? How does methodA know where to resume when methodB ends? It turns out that when methodA calls
   methodB, the address of the next instruction for methodA is placed on the stack. This is followed by the parameters
   for methodB, and then any local variables within methodB. All of this is called the "stack frame" for methodB. 
   When methodB returns, the stack frame is destroyed (all the parameters and variables are popped off the stack),
    and then the return address is popped off the stack.</p>

<p>When an unhandled exception causes the stack to <strong>unwind</strong>, the stack frame is destroyed, the return address is
   popped off the stack and you are back in the calling method. If that calling method does not have a catch block
   for the exception, the stack is unwound further, until a catch block is found or until you pop out of the main
   method, in which case the default exception handler will terminate the program.</p>
